It is now one of the fastest growing waste streams.\n\nElectrical and electronic equipment (EEE) contains hazardous substances. Since 2003, EU laws have restricted the use of these hazardous substances.\n\n## Background\n\nThe rise in the production and use of electrical and electronic products, such as mobile phones, computers and kitchen appliances, has resulted in an increasing volume of electrical and electronic waste. During the use, collection, treatment and disposal of such waste, products may release harmful (hazardous) substances such as lead, mercury and cadmium, which can cause major environmental and health problems.\n\nTo address such challenges, EU laws restrict the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment through the [RoHS Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011L0065-20160715). In parallel, [the WEEE Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en) promotes the collection and recycling of such equipment.\n\nThe RoHS Directive currently restricts the use of ten substances: lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP).\n\nAll products with an electrical and electronic component, unless specifically excluded, have to comply with these restrictions.\n\nIn 2017, the Commission adopted a [legislative proposal](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1485526057244&uri=CELEX:52017PC0038) adjusting the scope of the RoHS Directive.\n\n- 13 JANUARY 2021\n\nFAQ key guidance document - RoHS\n\nEnglish\n\n(221.86 KB - PDF)\n\n[Preview](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/document/download/051e7e21-a0cc-4cb0-a3aa-ae6cb7f13488_en?filename=FAQ%20key%20guidance%20document%20-%20RoHS.pdf) [Download](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/document/download/051e7e21-a0cc-4cb0-a3aa-ae6cb7f13488_en?filename=FAQ%20key%20guidance%20document%20-%20RoHS.pdf)\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe RoHS Directive aims to prevent the risks posed to human health and the environment related to the management of electronic and electrical waste.\n\nIt does this by restricting the use of certain hazardous substances in EEE that can be substituted by safer alternatives. These restricted substances include heavy metals, flame retardants or plasticizers.\n\nThe Directive promotes the recyclability of EEE, as EEE and its components that have become waste contain fewer hazardous substances. At the same time, it ensures a level playing field for manufacturers and importers of EEE in the European market.\n\n## Law\n\n- [RoHS Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0065)\n- [2017 Directive amending RoHS Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1512061986553&uri=CELEX:32017L2102)\n\n### Delegated Directives amending RoHS Annexes\n\nRestricted substances (Annex II)\n\n- [Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2015/863](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L0863) of 31 March 2015\n\nExemptions (Annex III and IV)\n\n- [RoHS Directive (consolidated version)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1584116022829&uri=CELEX:02011L0065-20200301)\n- Exemption 48 IV -

Two studies supported the review process: the first study, published in March 2021, gathered data on the question whether the Directive is still fit for purpose. The second study, published in March 2023, explored potential options and their impacts as well as supplemented the findings from the first study. Stakeholders were consulted via open public and targeted consultations.\n- [Support for the evaluation of Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5b807311-9d93-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-278322860)\n- [Study to support the assessment of impacts associated with the general review of Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS Directive)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b9188764-f465-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-286516984)\n- As a result of this review, the Commission published on 7 December 2023 a review report according to Art.24(2) of that Directive accompanied with a staff working document on the evaluation.\n- [Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the review of the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/190a38de-94f6-11ee-b164-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-298061154)\n- [Commission staff working document on the evaluation of Directive 2011/65/EU](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/54c7cd21-94f6-11ee-b164-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-298061154)\n- Under the horizontal initiative ‘ [one substance, one assessment](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6413)’, it is proposed to re-attribute scientific and technical tasks under the RoHS Directive to the European Chemicals Agency.\n- [Proposal for a Directive on the re-attribution of scientific and technical tasks to the European Chemicals Agency](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-re-attribution-scientific-and-technical-tasks-european-chemicals-agency_en)\n\n### On the RoHS 2 scope review\n\n- [Report - Measures to be implemented and additional impact assessment with regard to scope changes, pursuant to the new RoHS Directive](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/636f928d-2669-41d3-83db-093e90ca93a2/library/e9147919-9232-444e-9a3d-007fb9d158d0/details?download=true)\n- [Report - Additional Input to the Commission Impact Assessment for a Review of the Scope Provisions of the RoHS Directive Pursuant to Article 24(1)](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/636f928d-2669-41d3-83db-093e90ca93a2/library/732c385e-1103-4ba6-81d0-3ac72fb1e38d/details?download=true)\n- [Study for the analysis of impacts from RoHS2 on non-road mobile machinery without an on-board power source, on windows and doors with electric functions, and on the refurbishment of medical devices](https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0b999e51-c395-4c9e-ae0a-cfe7efbd6804)\n\n### On the review of the list of restricted substances\n\n- [Study to support the review of the list of restricted substances and to assess a new exemption request under RoHS 2 (Pack 15)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-190653414)\n\n\nThe information and views set out in this study are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Commission.

Priority is given to older applications. Existing exemptions for which a renewal request has been submitted remain valid until a decision is taken by the Commission. This decision either indicates a new expiry date or, in case of rejection, grants a transition period of 12 to 18 months before the exemption expires. When deciding about a new expiry date, the renewal application period of 18 months will be taken into consideration. Exemptions for which no application for renewal was submitted in due time will expire on the date specified in Article 5 or in the relevant annex of the Directive.\n\nFor exemptions that are under review but for which no new expiry date has yet been set by a new delegated directive and for which a current expiry date lies in the past, there is normally no need to submit a new renewal application. A submission may be required in exceptional cases, e.g. if new evidence affects the recommended scope.\n\nAfter submitting a request for a new exemption, equipment must comply with the Directive to be placed on the Union market, until a decision granting a new exemption is adopted by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission evaluation procedure involves several steps:\n\n1. The technical and scientific assessment study and stakeholder consultation typically takes around 10 months.\n2. Once a proposal has been made, the Commission consults with Member States and the European Parliament. You can access the agendas and minutes of the Member States [expert group for RoHS 2 adaptation and enforcement](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&groupId=2810&fromMeetings=true&meetingId=58005) in the [Register of Commission Expert Groups](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/home?lang=en) **.**\n3. The [draft delegated directive/decision is then published](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives) for public feedback (4 weeks) and notified to the [WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_com_e.htm) (60 days).\n4. The Delegated Directive will then be adopted by the Commission. The draft [Delegated directives adopted](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/?fuseaction=search) by the Commission are available before official publication. The status of the draft delegated act is available in the [Interinstitutional register of delegated acts](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/regdel/#/home).\n5. The two-month scrutiny period of the European Parliament and the Council commences (an extension of the scrutiny period on request is possible). After this scrutiny period, in case of no objections from the co-legislators, the Delegated Directive will be published in the [Official Journal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html?locale=en).\n\n## Technical and Scientific Assessment Studies\n\n### RoHS stakeholder consultations\n\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/news) on 9 exemption requests under Pack 28; from 6 June until 1 August 2025\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.biois.eu/requests2b.html) on 10 exemption requests under Pack 27; from 8 November 2023 until 18 January 2024\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.biois.eu/requests2.html) on 9 exemption requests under Pack 27; from 16 October 2023 to 11 December 2023\n- Stakeholder consultation on 8 exemption requests under Pack 24; carried out by [Oeko-Institut](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=362); from 30 March 2021 to 8 June 2021\n- Stakeholder consultation on 11 exemption requests under Pack 23; carried out by [Bio Innovation Service](http://rohs.biois.eu/requests3.html); from 18 March 2021 to 27 May 2021\n- [Stakeholder consultations](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=214) on 9 exemption requests under Pack 22; from 23 December 2020 to 3 March 2021\n- [Stakeholder consultations](https://rohs.biois.eu/requests.html) on 16 exemption requests under Pack 21; from 23 September to 2 December 2020\n- [Stakeholder consultations](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=350) on 2 exemption requests under Pack 19 and 20; from 10 January to 20 February 2020\n- [Stakeholder consultations](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=342) on 2 exemption requests under Pack 18; from 3 December 2019 until 27 January 2020\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=307) on 4 exemption requests under Pack 15 and 17; from 18/03/2019 to 13/05/2019\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=299) on 2 exemption requests under Pack 16; from 31/10/2018 to 19/12/2018\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=279) on 8 exemption requests; from 20/10/2017 to 01/12/2017\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/index.php?id=275) on 2 exemption requests; from 26/09/2017 to 07/11/2017\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs_en.htm) on 2 exemption requests; from 28/10/2016 to 22/12/2016\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs16_en.htm) on 2 exemption requests; from 14/03/2016 to 09/05/2016\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs15_en.htm) on 2 exemption requests; from 30/10/2015 to 08/01/2016\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs14_en.htm) on 83 exemption requests; from 21/08/2015 to 16/10/2015\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs13_en.htm) on 6 exemption requests; from 24/04/2015 to 19/06/2015\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs12_en.htm) on 2 exemption requests; from 31/10/2014 to 09/01/2015\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs9_en.htm) on 1 exemption request; from 20/12/2013 to 28/02/2014\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs7_en.htm) on 5 exemption requests; from 19/08/2013 to 11/11/2013\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs6_en.htm) on 3 exemption requests; from 21/12/2012 to 15/02/2013\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs5_en.htm) on 4 exemption requests; from 09/11/2012 to 01/02/2013\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs4_en.htm) on 11 exemption requests; from 26/06/2012 to 04/09/2012\n- [Stakeholder consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/rohs3_en.htm) on 18 exemption requests; from 24/01/2012 to 20/03/2012\n\n### Assessment studies on exemptions\n\nThe Commission frequently receives requests from industry for applications to be exempted from the substance restrictions of the RoHS Directive. These requests need to be evaluated in order to assess whether they fulfil the requirements mentioned in Article 5 of the Directive.\n\nThe full list of exemption requests submitted to the Commission between November 2019 and January 2020 can be consulted [here](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/waste/rohs_eee/RoHS_exemption_applications_submitted_Nov19-Jan20_NEW.zip).\n\n#### Completed

The RoHS 2 Directive is part of the European Union's horizontal waste management legislation.\n\nThis Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is principally intended to help economic operators interpret the provisions of RoHS 2 in order to ensure compliance with the Directive's requirements. However, the Directive being addressed only to the Member States, the rights and obligations for private parties exclusively flow from the measures enacted by the authorities of the Member States to implement it.\n\nThe FAQ is considered a 'living document' and may be revised in the future, according to the experience with the implementation and review of RoHS 2.\n\nThese FAQ reflect the views of DG Environment and as such are not legally binding: binding interpretation of EU legislation is the exclusive competence of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nThese FAQ should be read in conjunction with the general principles of the New Legislative Framework (NLF) and the Commission's guide to the implementation of directives based on the New Approach and the Global Approach (hereafter referred to as the Blue Guide)<sup>1</sup>.\n\nThe Commission launched a second impact assessment study on the scope changes going beyond the original recast proposal. The results of this study will be the basis for the 2014 scope review, which may lead to scope related adjustments.\n\n<span id=\"page-3-2\"></span><span id=\"page-3-1\"></span><span id=\"page-3-2\"></span><span id=\"page-3-1\"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup> <u>http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/documents/blue-guide/</u>\n\n## <span id=\"page-4-0\"></span><span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>1. General\n\n#### <span id=\"page-4-1\"></span><span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>Q1.1 What was the intention behind the RoHS-recast?\n\nThe RoHS-recast was mainly aimed at\n\n- developing better regulatory conditions. That means a simple, effective and enforceable Directive;\n- increasing the level of legal clarity and certainty, including the facilitation of its harmonised enforcement;\n- the adaptation of the Directive to the technical and scientific progress concerning the use of hazardous substances in EEE particularly in medical devices and monitoring and control instruments;\n- aligning and harmonising RoHS with other EU legislation, such as the New Legislative Framework - 'Marketing of Products Package', REACH<sup>2</sup>, the ErP Directive<sup>3</sup> and legislation related to management of waste from EEE with the objective to reduce administrative burden and to increase cost effectiveness;\n- harmonising the implementation made in the different Member States; and\n- preventing risks to human health and the environment, with a particular focus on workers involved in the management of electronic waste.\n\n# <span id=\"page-4-2\"></span><span id=\"page-4-2\"></span>Q1.2 What is the difference between Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1) and Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2)?\n\nThere are key differences between RoHS 1 and RoHS 2 in the following areas:\n\n- 1.

At that time RoHS 1 will be repealed.\n\nFrom 22nd July 2014 the substance restrictions will gradually be extended to new product categories. The provisions of RoHS 2 will also apply for these types of EEE[5](#page-4-3) from the dates mentioned below:\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/7 description: The image shows a timeline of extensions to categories. The first extension is on 22nd July 2014 to Category 8 (medical devices) and Category 9 (monitoring and control instruments). The second extension is on 22nd July 2016 to Category 8 In vitro diagnostic medical devices. The third extension is on 22nd July 2017 to Category 9 Industrial monitoring and control instruments. The fourth extension is on 23rd July 2019 to all EEE except for the ones explicitly excluded.\n\nCables, spare parts for the repair, the reuse, the updating of functionalities or upgrading of capacity for a specific product category, must comply from the same date as their respective product category. Following the principle of 'repair as produced', spare parts for the specific products already on the market before the dates mentioned above are exempted.\n\nThe requirements for CE marking and Declaration of Conformity are effective from 3rd January 2013 (for applicability see section 8 of this document).\n\n#### <span id=\"page-5-1\"></span><span id=\"page-5-1\"></span>*Q1.4 Why are the hazardous substances restricted in RoHS 2 not restricted in all products?*\n\nOne of the prime objectives of RoHS 2 is to address concerns related to the increasing volume of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) arising in the EU. Hazardous substances in this type of equipment could be released during waste management processes and could give rise to damage to human health and the environment. The most effective way to address this concern is to restrict the use of\n\n<span id=\"page-5-2\"></span><span id=\"page-5-2\"></span> <sup>5</sup> Please note that the scope of EEE in RoHS 2 has been clarified and there may be differing interpretations of the old scope in various Member States. This may affect the date of applicability of the provisions of RoHS 2.\n\nthe hazardous substances at the point of manufacture. Restricting the use of hazardous substances in EEE at the point of manufacture also reduces the potential exposure of hazardous substances during the use phase where dermal, oral and inhalation exposure can occur. The EU has also legislated on hazardous substances in relation to other priority waste streams, such as end-of-life vehicles, batteries and packaging.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-0\"></span><span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Q1.5 How are REACH and RoHS 2 related to each other?\n\nRoHS and REACH are two different acts with different scopes and objectives. RoHS 2 is a sector specific directive laying down rules on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in EEE, while REACH is a general act regulating registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemical substances.\n\nRoHS 2 does not affect the application of REACH, and vice-versa, with regard to the restriction of substances in EEE. When overlaps occur, the strongest restriction (i.e. the lowest maximum concentration) should be applied. Furthermore, exemptions from the substance restrictions in RoHS 2 may not be granted if they result in a weakening of the environmental and human health protection afforded by REACH.\n\nRecital 28 in RoHS 2 requires that during the review of the Directive, a thorough analysis of its coherence with REACH shall be carried out by the Commission. To secure coherence between RoHS 2 and REACH:\n\n- both the methodology for prospective substance restrictions and the criteria for granting exemptions should be coherent with REACH.\n- the available information according to the REACH procedures shall be used for future substance related RoHS amendments.\n\nThe first review of RoHS 2 is due by July 2014 and will also address the development of a methodology for any future amendments to the list of restricted substances.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-1\"></span><span id=\"page-6-1\"></span>Q1.6 Are batteries within the scope of RoHS?\n\nNo. Recital 14 of RoHS 2 specifically states that RoHS should apply without prejudice to the Batteries Directive. Recital 29 of the batteries and accumulators directive (2006/66/EC<sup>6</sup>) states RoHS does not apply to batteries and accumulators used in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-2\"></span><span id=\"page-6-2\"></span>Q1.7 How can I find out if RoHS 2 applies to my product?\n\nTo find out if the requirements of RoHS 2 apply to your product follow the decision tree below:\n\n<span id=\"page-6-3\"></span><span id=\"page-6-3\"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>6</sup> Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC.\n\nImage /page/7/Figure/1 description: The image is a flowchart that outlines the steps to determine if a product is subject to RoHS 2 regulations. The flowchart starts with the question \"Is my product EEE? (see definitions in articles 3 (1), (2) and (5))\". If the answer is yes, the flowchart proceeds to the next question: \"Is it excluded from the scope of RoHS 2 via article 2(4)?\". If the answer is no, the flowchart indicates that \"EEE is in the scope; provisions of RoHS 2 apply\". If the answer is yes, the flowchart indicates that \"Out of scope; provisions of RoHS 2 don't apply\". If the answer to the first question is no, the flowchart indicates that \"Out of scope, provisions of RoHS 2 don't apply\". If the answer to the second question is no, the flowchart proceeds to the next question: \"Are there substance exemptions in Annex III or IV being applied?\". If the answer is yes, the flowchart indicates that \"All requirements apply except for the specific substance exemption(s)\". If the answer is no, the flowchart indicates that \"All requirements of RoHS 2 apply\".\n\n### <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span><span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>*Q1.8 Where can I ask questions about the provisions of RoHS 2?*\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact DG Environment. Alternatively, a list of national authorities can be found here:\n\n[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/contacts\\\\_ms\\\\_rohs.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/contacts_ms_rohs.pdf)\n\n# <span id=\"page-7-1\"></span><span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>**2. Scope – Article 2(2)**\n\n<span id=\"page-7-2\"></span><span id=\"page-7-2\"></span>*Q2.1 What does \"Without prejudice to Article 4(3) and 4(4), Member States shall provide that EEE that was outside the scope of Directive 2002/95/EC, but which would not comply with this Directive, may nevertheless continue to be made available on the market until 22 July 2019\" mean?* \n\nArticle 2(2)[7](#page-6-3) of RoHS 2 states that non-compliant EEE that were outside the scope of RoHS 1 but inside the scope of RoHS 2 must be granted full market access until 22 July 2019, unless the granted transition period is limited via Articles 4(3) and 4(4).\n\n#### <span id=\"page-7-3\"></span><span id=\"page-7-3\"></span>*Q2.2 Which products benefit from this provision? (Articles 2(2), 2(1), 3(1), 3(2), 4(3), 4(4))*\n\nAll category 11 products may benefit from the transitional period of Article 2(2), but also products in other categories that only now fall within the scope of RoHS 2 due to\n\n<span id=\"page-7-4\"></span><span id=\"page-7-4\"></span> <sup>7</sup> Commission Declaration on the scope (Article 2(2)):\n\n[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2010-](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2010-0431+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN#BKMD-9) [0431+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN#BKMD-9](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2010-0431+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN#BKMD-9)\n\na new scope related provision, such as the clarified definition of EEE, which comprises any piece of equipment that needs electric currents or electromagnetic fields for at least one intended function.[8](#page-7-4)\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>*Q2.3 What does \"making available on the market\" mean in this context? (Articles 2(2), 3(11), 3(12))*\n\nMaking available on the market includes the placing on the market, i.e. the first making available (on the market) and all secondary market operations, for example resale. This means that the products benefiting from Article 2(2) will have full market access until 22 July 2019. However, after that date none of these products shall be allowed to remain on the market even if they have been placed there before that date. This means that the distribution chain within the EU must be clear of these non-compliant products by 22 July 2019.\n\nThe Commission addressed this issue in the second (ex post) impact assessment study on the scope changes.[9](#page-8-3) Based on the consultants' recommendations, the Commission will address this issue in the planned Commission impact assessment due in 2013 as a basis for a Commission proposal in the first half of 2014, under the RoHS 2 Article 24(1) mandate.\n\n#### *Q2.4 What does \"non-compliant\" mean? (Articles 2(2), 4(1), 4(2), 13, 15)*\n\nNon-compliant means products that do not comply with the maximum concentration values, or that do not comply with the applicable procedural requirements under RoHS 2 (i.e. Declaration of Conformity and CE marking).\n\n## <span id=\"page-8-1\"></span><span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>**3. Scope – Large-scale Exclusions**\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-2\"></span><span id=\"page-8-2\"></span>*Q3.1 What are \"large-scale stationary industrial tools\" and \"large-scale fixed installations\"? (Articles 2(4)(d) and 2(4)(e))*\n\nUnlike RoHS 1, RoHS 2 has an open scope. However, several product groups are excluded from the RoHS 2 scope.[10](#page-8-4) Two of the exclusions listed in Article 2(4) refer to combinations of EEE in a professional context, i.e. \"large-scale stationary industrial tools\" (Article 2(4)(d)) and \"large-scale fixed installations\" (Article 2(4)(e)).\n\nBoth terms are explained in the definitions (Articles 3(3) and 3(4)), however it is not explained what \"large-scale\" means. Both categories are combinations of various types of items, such as machinery, components etc. for permanent use at a specific place, installed and de-installed by professionals. Therefore the two categories may overlap. However, it is important to consider that the meaning of \"large-scale\" in absolute terms may be a different one for tools and installations, as there are differences between tools and installations.\n\n <sup>8</sup> Please note that the RoHS 1 scope was based on WEEE 1. Some Member States took a broader scope interpretation. As a result, how Article 2(2) is applied will also depend on Member States' implementation of RoHS 1.\n\n<span id=\"page-8-4\"></span><span id=\"page-8-3\"></span><span id=\"page-8-4\"></span><span id=\"page-8-3\"></span><sup>9</sup> Final report: [http://rohs.biois.com/product-group-factsheets;](http://rohs.biois.com/product-group-factsheets) link at top of the page. See also preface. <sup>10</sup> In principle, exclusions can apply to any of the Annex I product categories.\n\nTools are essentially machines, stand-alone or assemblies, often with moving parts, and used for example for the treatment or manufacturing of materials and work pieces. The Machinery Directive[11](#page-8-4) can be used as guidance. Typical machine tools can also be part of fixed installations.\n\nIn order to benefit from either exclusion the tool or installation must meet all the respective requirements. As stated below, it has to be:\n\n(Tool)\n\n- an assembly of machines, equipment and/or components, functioning together for a specific application;\n- permanently installed and de-installed by professionals at a given place;\n- used and maintained by professionals in an industrial manufacturing facility or R&D facility;\n- and it has to be large-scale;\n\n(Installation)\n\n- a combination of several types of apparatus and, where applicable, other devices;\n- assembled, installed and de-installed by professionals;\n- with the intention to be used permanently in a pre-defined and dedicated location;\n- and it has to be large-scale.\n\n\"Large-scale\" is part of both sets of requirements. Evidently, this draws a line between \"larger\" tools and installations benefiting from an exclusion, and otherwise similar, \"smaller\" equipment. \"Large-scale\" refers to dimensional or similar criteria as explained below, although this criterion is not specified in the RoHS 2.\n\n**It is the responsibility of the manufacturer, importer, or any other economic operator involved to assess whether his tool or installation benefits from either exclusion.** Where a combination of equipment, components and sub-assemblies is being brought together or combined and placed on the market as a single piece of equipment or a manufacturing process line, then consideration could be given to application of other directives such as the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), Low Voltage and Machinery Directives.\n\nDue to the nature of both definitions, assigning broad types or classes of equipment to either category is not possible. Decisions are to be taken on a case-by-case basis considering all criteria in each definition. The purpose of the following non-exhaustive lists of examples and criteria is to support those decisions.\n\nExamples of large-scale fixed installations (benefiting from an exclusion):\n\n- Production and processing lines, including robots and machine tools (industrial, food, print media etc.);\n- Passenger lifts;\n- Conveyor transport systems;\n\n <sup>11</sup> <http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/mechanical/documents/legislation/machinery/>\n\n- Automated storage systems;\n- Electrical distribution systems such as generators;\n- Railway signalling infrastructure;\n- Fixed installed cooling, air conditioning and refrigerating systems or heating systems designed exclusively for non-residential use.\n\nExamples of large-scale stationary industrial tools (benefiting from an exclusion):\n\n- Machines for the industrial production and processing of materials and goods, such as\n  - o CNC lathes;\n  - Bridge-type milling and drilling machines;\n  - Metal forming presses;\n  - Newspaper printing presses;\n- Machines for the testing of work pieces, such as\n  - Electron beam, laser, bright light, and deep ultra violet defect detection systems;\n  - o Automated integrated circuit board and printed wiring board testers;\n- Cranes;\n- Other machinery of similar size, complexity and weight.\n\nBuildings and sites, chemical plants etc. are not installations; however they may contain various subsystems that can be addressed as installations or tools pursuant to RoHS 2. The key characteristic of a subsystem is that its elements are interdependent and connected. Some subsystems may be outside the scope of RoHS 2 from the start, as they do not comprise EEE, or may be excluded installations or tools. EEE that is specifically designed for such subsystems outside the scope of RoHS 2, also benefits from the exclusion via Article 2(4)(c).\n\nAs a general rule, bench top tools and IT equipment do not fall within the category of large-scale stationary industrial tools.\n\nTools and installations that do not fall within the examples above should be assessed individually with respect to the wording of the exclusions. **The burden of proof is with the responsible economic operator.** Where a tool or installation does benefit from the exclusion, all its constituent components that are part of it when placed on the market are also excluded.\n\nMachinery that has partial mobility, for example semi-mobile machinery running on rails, can be of 'permanent use'. On the other hand, EEE that is intended to be used on different sites during its life is not considered as permanent. It is an indicator of permanent use if the equipment is not readily re-locatable (or 'mobile intended') and if it is intended for use at one single location.\n\nAs for the industrial context for professional installation and de-installation, scenarios such as the need for special assembling equipment, required permits, if the commissioning is a professional engineering exercise, specialised training, considerable installation time etc. can be indicators.\n\nAs regards \"large-scale\", this is especially relevant to tools such as stand-alone industrial machines placed individually on the market. \"Large-scale\" can be used to identify and differentiate between tools because of their size, weight, capacity, throughput or other performance related criteria. It also relates to tool or installation complexity, and to the effort needed for installing, operating, maintaining and de-installing a tool or an installation.\n\nOne possible way of introducing a direct size criterion relates to transportation. The following guidance metrics and qualitative criteria can be applied for installations. If the **installation** exceeds the minimum requirements for **one** of the following criteria, it can be considered large-scale:\n\n- If, when installing or de-installing the installation, it is too large to be moved in an ISO 20 foot container because the total sum of its parts as transported is larger than 5,71m x 2,35m x 2,39m, it can be considered large-scale.\n- The maximum weight of many road trucks is 44 tonnes. Thus if, when installing or de-installing the installation, it is too heavy to be moved by a 44 tonne road truck, because the total sum of its parts as transported weighs more than the truck's load capacity, it can be considered large-scale.\n- If heavy-duty cranes are needed for installation or de-installation, the installation can be considered large-scale.\n- An installation that does not fit within a normal industrial environment, without the environment needing structural modification, can be considered large-scale. Examples for modifications are modified access areas, strengthened foundations etc.\n- If an installation has a rated power greater than 375 kW, it can be considered large-scale.\n\n#### This is only an indicative list.\n\nAs explained above, \"large-scale\" does not necessarily have the same meaning for tools and installations. Tools that are large-scale in comparison to smaller industrial tools can be significantly smaller than large-scale installations. Therefore, tools do not need to match the above listed criteria for installations. However if they do, they are in any case large-scale. The following criteria can be applied to tools as installed, but specific guidance metrics should be developed.<sup>12</sup> Any of the following criteria can be an indicator:\n\n- Dimensions (for guidance see above listed examples of tools);\n  - o Tool size;\n  - Size, movement or force of moving parts;\n- Weight (for guidance see above listed examples of tools).\n\nWhere the size or weight of a tool or an installation is close to the guidance metrics for large-scale, or where it is difficult to determine its exact size or weight with regard to\n\n<span id=\"page-11-0\"></span><span id=\"page-11-0\"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>12</sup> In order to ensure legal certainty, specific guidance metrics for large-scale tools based on available technical data should be developed in the course of the implementation and enforcement of RoHS 2, and incorporated in a revised version of this guidance document. The benchmarks for large tools should be between and significantly different from those for large household appliances as discussed under WEEE 2, and those for large installations as listed in this document.\n\nits classification as large-scale, complexity or required utilities may be taken into consideration as a qualitative indicator. An indicator of complexity is that the tool consists of several hundred components interrelated to form subsystems for process parameters which comprise the tool's intended function. Indicative utilities may include special power connections and utility connections other than clean dry air or water supply and drain, such as high pressure compressed gas supply, vacuum lines, toxic or heat exhaust connections, or chemical supply lines and drains.\n\n#### *Q3.2 Does the LSSIT/LSFI scope exclusion also cover equipment such as IT and telecommunication equipment, medical devices or industrial monitoring and control instruments?*\n\nIn principle, scope exclusions can apply to any of the Annex I product categories. However, any equipment which is not specifically designed and installed as part of an excluded tool or installation, is in the scope of this Directive. Smoke detectors, computers and cables are examples of equipment that are in scope.\n\n# *Q3.3 Who is responsible for items that are to be used in LSSIT/LSFIs?*\n\nPursuant to Article 2(4)(c), read in conjunction with Article 2 (4)(d) and (e), RoHS 2 does not apply to equipment which is specifically designed, and is to be installed, as part of LSSIT or LSFI. Whilst the obligations which the Directive imposes on the manufacturer of EEE and the different actors in the distribution chain will therefore not apply as such with regard to said equipment, a given manufacturer may nevertheless have to ensure and establish that the conditions laid down in Article 2 (4)(c) are fulfilled. The other actors may then have to provide documentation and information to this extent. Despite the absence of installers' obligations in the text of the RoHS Directive, one cannot exclude that the installer who does not manufacture the equipment at issue would have to bear such documentation and information responsibilities.\n\n# **4. Scope – Other Exclusions**\n\n### *Q4.1 What is meant by \"specifically designed equipment\" (Article 2(4)c and Article 2(4)j)*\n\n\"Specifically designed\" equipment is mentioned in two of the Directive's exclusions (Article 2(4)(c) and Article 2(4)(j)). All exclusions in Article 2(4) are exclusive to their nature. This means that equipment that can be used according to the exclusion, but also for purposes within the scope of RoHS 2, will need to comply. The wording \"specifically designed\", as stated in Article 2(4)(c) and Article 2(4)(j), reflects this principle.\n\nThe exclusion in Article 2(4)(c) applies to equipment that is specifically designed to be fitted into another piece of equipment that is itself excluded from scope.\n\nSpecifically designed EEE normally means that it is tailor made; it is designed to meet the need of a specific application. For example, for EEE to be specifically designed to a LSFI it needs to be designed, dimensioned and customised according to the need of the application.\n\nFor 'specifically designed' EEE to benefit from the exclusion of 2(4)(c) it must be intended only to be installed in another type of equipment that is excluded. Thus if a particular EEE can function in excluded and in scope equipment, it would be in scope unless it can be demonstrated (e.g. with sales documents, installation instructions, marketing literature, etc.) that it is only to be installed in an excluded equipment.\" See also questions 4.4 to 4.6.\n\nThe exclusion in Article 2(4)(j) applies to equipment that is designed for the sole purpose of research and development. Equipment that could be used for R&D purposes, but also for example monitoring and control, do not benefit from the exclusion but should comply with the requirements. See also Q4.2 about the R&D exclusion.\n\n## *Q4.2 Is R&D equipment excluded from RoHS 2?*\n\nEquipment specifically designed solely for the purpose of research and development, which is made available solely on a business-to-business basis, are excluded from the scope of RoHS 2. This is because if this type of equipment were to fall within scope of RoHS 2, it could place a burden on research, scientific advancement, development and innovation in the EU.\n\n'Research and Development' (R&D) are activities which directly contribute to achieving advances in science or technology. EEE designed solely to achieve these objectives and only made available on a business to business basis meets the criteria and are excluded from the scope of RoHS 2.\n\nThis exclusion will only apply to specialised EEE that are custom built solely for very specific R&D applications. Standard equipment such as monitoring devices or instruments for chemical analysis and other laboratory equipment that can be used both for R&D applications and in commercial or other applications, will not benefit from this exclusion. Neither does it apply to equipment designed and put on the market to test, validate or monitor R&D equipment and/or prototypes as that equipment would belong to category 9.\n\nIn order to benefit from the R&D exclusion, the equipment concerned should be custom made for a specific client or a small number of clients involved in scientific research or prototype product development.\n\nExamples of EEE that may benefit from this exclusion include:\n\n- non-finished products such as prototype or sample/test EEE\n- in-house custom built \"development vehicles\" used solely for development, test, validation and evaluation of such non-finished products, including the evaluation of regulatory compliance, product performance and determination of customer acceptability\n\nThis type of EEE belongs to the conceptual, developmental, design or pre-production stage and is as such designed for R&D use.\n\n## *Q4.3 Are EEE built into buildings outside of scope?*\n\nArticle 2(4)(c) refers to \"another type of equipment\" which is outside the scope of the directive. Buildings are not considered equipment for the purposes of RoHS 2. Therefore equipment that is installed in a building cannot be excluded on the basis of Article 2(4)(c). Installations in a building may be excluded if they meet the criteria of LSSIT or LSFI; see section 3 for guidance.\n\n## *Q4.4 What is meant by \"multiple\" or \"dual\" use?*\n\nEEE with \"multiple use\" or \"dual use\" have uses that are inside and outside the scope.\n\nThe term \"dual use\" is widely used by industry and enforcement authorities in the same sense as \"multiple use\" above. In the context of the WEEE Directive (2002/96/EC), \"dual use\" however refers to the distinction between consumer and professional use. This distinction is not relevant in RoHS 2; the same requirements are applied to EEE regardless of their sector of use.\n\n### *Q4.5 If EEE has multiple uses of which one is in the scope of RoHS 2, does the EEE have to comply\"?*\n\nEEE that is intended to have at least one use within the scope of RoHS 2 has to comply with the provisions of the directive. For instance, a fridge that could be installed in either a commercial vehicle or a hotel room is included within the scope (even though the first example is excluded via Article 2(4)(f) in conjunction with Article 2(4)(c))Non-road mobile machinery that is made available to both professionals and consumers, for example via their point of sale, will also have to comply. Likewise, EEE that can be used for the protection of the essential interests of the security of Member States, but has also other uses, will be in scope and have to comply.\n\nThe term 'intended use' is explained in the Blue Guide.\n\n## *Q4.6 Can multiple use EEE that is non-compliant be sold for the use in excluded products?*\n\nWhen a non-compliant EEE is placed or made available on the market for an excluded use, the economic operator placing it or making it available on the market is responsible for having full knowledge of the intended use of the equipment. Therefore each economic operator is responsible for assuring that the EEE is only made available for the uses outside of the scope of RoHS 2 (Article 11).\n\n# **5. Scope – Cables**\n\n# *Q5.1 Are cables within the scope of RoHS 2?*\n\nGenerally from 3 January 2013 cables are in scope of RoHS2, unless they specifically belong to an EEE or a combination of EEE that is outside the scope of RoHS 2. Cables that are used for the transfer of electrical currents or electromagnetic fields are EEE.[13](#page-11-0) Cables that fall within one of the product categories of RoHS 1 were already in\n\n<span id=\"page-14-1\"></span><span id=\"page-14-0\"></span><span id=\"page-14-1\"></span><span id=\"page-14-0\"></span> <sup>13</sup> Optical cables are not EEE and therefore not in scope of RoHS 2. See Q7.2.\n\nthe scope of RoHS 1.[14](#page-14-0) This is already reflected in the Commission's RoHS 1 FAQs.[15](#page-14-1)\n\nIn order to place a cable in a specific category, the type and intended use of the cable must be taken into consideration. Specialised cables such as SCART-cables, HDMIcables and network-cables, which are used for example in voice, data and video transfer, are in categories 3 or 4. Non-finished cables such as cable reels without plugs were not in the scope of RoHS1 and can be classified as category 11. Cables that were not in the scope of RoHS 1 are exempted from the RoHS provisions until 22 July 2019.[16](#page-15-0)\n\nCables can form part of another EEE placed on the market, or they can be placed on the market individually. Cables that form part of an EEE can be internal (permanently attached) or external (externally connected and removable, but sold together or marketed/shipped for use with the EEE). Cables specifically intended for medical equipment and monitoring and control equipment will come under the RoHS provisions on the appropriate dates.\n\n### *Q5.2 What are the requirements for internal wires and internal cables?*\n\nInternal wires are not cables. Internal wiring in any EEE that is within the scope of RoHS 2 must simply meet the material restrictions like all other parts of the EEE; there is no individual CE marking and DoC requirement. If an EEE is subject to a transition period or a scope exclusion, the same applies to the internal wiring. The same principle applies to permanently attached cables, e.g. most lamp cables.\n\n#### *Q5.3 What are the requirements for external cables?*\n\nExternal cables that form part of another EEE because they are sold together or marketed/shipped for use with an EEE, e.g. power cords, must meet the material restrictions but do not need an individual CE marking and Declaration of Conformity if they are covered by the DoC for the EEE and the EEE is CE marked. [17](#page-15-1) The cable always follows the same technical requirements as the EEE it belongs to.\n\nExternal cables placed on the market separately that are not part of another EEE must meet the material restrictions and will need their own Declaration of Conformity and CE marking from the relevant date.\n\n# **6. General Open Scope**\n\n#### *Q6.1 Which types of equipment benefit from the exclusions from the scope?*\n\nNon-exhaustive examples of excluded equipment as per the corresponding exclusion in Article 2(4) include the following:\n\n <sup>14</sup> Please note that some Member States classified multi-use cables with connectors at both ends such as extension cords and blocks as category 2 already under RoHS 1. <sup>15</sup> See [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/faq\\\\_weee.pdf,](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/faq_weee.pdf) Q1.17 on modular cabling\n\nsystems for voice, data and video applications.\n\n<span id=\"page-15-1\"></span><span id=\"page-15-0\"></span><span id=\"page-15-1\"></span><span id=\"page-15-0\"></span><sup>16</sup> This is also reflected in the Commission Declaration on the scope; see footnote 7. <sup>17</sup> Please note however that other applicable legislation such as the Low Voltage Directive may require individual CE marking and DoC.\n\n| Reference          | Summary Exclusion                                     | Example equipment                                                             |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Article<br>2(4)(a) | Military/security equipment                           | Missiles<br>Battlefield computers                                             |\n| Article<br>2(4)(b) | Designed to be sent into<br>space                     | Satellites<br>Space probes                                                    |\n| Article<br>2(4)(c) | Part of non-scope<br>equipment                        | Computers specifically built to be<br>installed in aircraft                   |\n| Article<br>2(4)(d) | Large-scale stationary<br>industrial tools<br>(LSSIT) | Production and processing lines<br>Cranes<br>See also Q3.1                    |\n| Article<br>2(4)(e) | Large-scale fixed<br>installations<br>(LSFI)          | Lifts<br>Conveyor transport systems<br>See also Q3.1                          |\n| Article<br>2(4)(f) | Means of transport                                    | Cars,<br>commercial vehicles, aircraft,<br>trains, boats                      |\n| Article<br>2(4)(g) | Non-road mobile machinery<br>(NRMM)                   | Hydraulic excavators<br>Fork-lifts<br>Road maintenance equipment<br>Harvester |\n| Article<br>2(4)(h) | Active implantable medical<br>devices                 | Pacemakers                                                                    |\n| Article<br>2(4)(i) | Photovoltaic panels                                   | Solar arrays                                                                  |\n| Article<br>2(4)(j) | R&D equipment                                         | Watt balances<br>See also Q4.2                                                |\n\n#### *Q6.2 How do I decide which category of EEE a product falls in?*\n\nFor some categories of EEE such as medical devices, there is sector specific legislation (for example the Medical Devices Directive, 93/42/EEC[18](#page-15-1)) which sets out what types of products are included within its respective scope. In these cases, such sector specific legislation has priority.\n\nThe assignment of a product to a category relates primarily to the duration of the exemptions and corresponding transitional arrangements. The duration of the exemptions also depends on the equipment category. Detailed information on the duration of exemptions is contained in Q9.1.\n\nRegarding transitional arrangements, the qualification as EEE of a specific product is not as important as the initial assessment of whether the product is \"new to RoHS 2\"\n\n<span id=\"page-16-0\"></span><span id=\"page-16-0\"></span> <sup>18</sup> Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices.\n\nor not. Products that are \"new to RoHS 2\" are not only in the \"new\" categories 8, 9 and 11, but can also belong to any other category. This decision has to be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFrom 22 July 2019, all provisions in RoHS 2 will apply for all EEE that is not otherwise excluded from scope, and therefore the categories will only be relevant for exemptions.\n\nWhilst this is a decision for the manufacturer or importer, guidance can be sought from the competent authority in the Member State where the manufacturer or importer intends to market the product. By request from the competent authority, for example in an enforcement situation, the manufacturer/importer may need to justify its decision.\n\n## *Q6.3 Does RoHS 2 apply to EEE for professional and industrial use?*\n\nYes. RoHS 2, just as RoHS 1, does not distinguish between EEE for consumer use and EEE for professional and industrial use. In some cases however specific exclusions (Article 2(4)) or timelines (Article 4(3), 4(4) and 4(5)) may apply.\n\n## *Q6.4 Are telecommunication networks in scope?*\n\nYes. RoHS 2 Annex III exemption 7(b), which exempts lead in solder for IT and telecommunication networks sets out that those networks are in scope. The term \"IT and telecommunication networks\" also includes cable TV and other similar networks.\n\n### *Q6.5 Are electric boards in scope?*\n\nThis depends on whether the board is placed on the market as a finished EEE product (i.e., for direct use by an end user), or it is placed on the market as a component for further production or integration in to a finished EEE product. An electric panelboard for use in a dwelling is a device upon which various modules (such as circuit breakers) are placed. Both the board in itself and the modules placed upon it are usually standard equipment sold to builders or home owners for direct use and so are within the scope of RoHS 2.\n\nLikewise graphics cards for computers are also deemed within the scope of RoHS 2 if they are supplied as finished products and intended to perform an electrical or electronic function. Such cards, or an empty card, i.e. a card with no components or modules mounted, sold for further production or integration into a finished EEE product are however not finished EEE themselves.\n\n### *Q6.6 Are fuse boxes in scope?*\n\nOnly if a fuse box is placed on the market for direct use by an end user is in scope.\n\n## *Q6.7 Are active RFID tags in scope?*\n\nYes. RFID tags (active and passive) are in scope and should comply with RoHS 2 as they meet the definition of EEE as set out in Article 3(1), unless they benefit from an exclusion in Article 2(4). They are generally considered category 3.\n\nRFID tags are often used attached to other articles, for example for stock identification or theft control. The RFID tag is in these cases not deemed a part of the article, as it is not intended to function together with the article but rather to be removed prior to shipment or use (for example packaging). In this case, the requirements of RoHS 2 should apply to the RFID only and not to the article to which it is attached, unless the attached article is itself EEE and falls under scope.\n\nRFID which are attached permanently to (or are difficult to separate from) appliances/equipment falling into other Categories of RoHS, may be considered a component part of such appliances/equipment and thus be considered under the same category as that appliance/equipment.\n\n### *Q6.8 Does packaging have to comply to RoHS 2?*\n\nNo. Recital 14 states RoHS is without prejudice to specific waste management legislation therefore packaging pursuant to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive[19](#page-16-0) (94/62/EC) is outside the scope of RoHS 2.\n\n## *Q6.9 How should \"professional use\" be interpreted? Does it apply only at the first placing on the market, or also at later stages?*\n\n\"Professional use\", as referred to in the exclusion of non-road mobile machinery and the definition of industrial monitoring and control, refers to the use phase of the EEE. In order for EEE to be marketed for \"professional use\", its intended end user has to be a professional.\n\nIt should also be noted that RoHS 2 does not differentiate between EEE for professional or non-professional use other than in a few exclusions. These exclusions explicitly state that the equipment concerned is made available only for professional use, in order for the exclusion to apply.\n\nIn some cases a manufacturer may place EEE on the market with the intent that it is only used for professional use. However a distributor outside the control of the manufacturer may make the EEE available for a non-professional use (for example through sale or hire). In these cases the distributor is modifying the purpose of the EEE and therefore may be taking on the responsibility for the compliance of the EEE (Article 11).\n\n# **7. EEE, Components and Consumables**\n\n## *Q7.1 Is my product EEE as per Articles 3(1) and (3)2?*\n\nThere are two elements clarifying the meaning of EEE in RoHS 2:\n\n- a general definition of EEE in Article 3(1);\n- a definition of \"dependent\" in Article 3(2).\n\nAll equipment that has at least one intended function which is dependent on electric current or electromagnetic fields, or that generates or transfers or measures such currents and fields is EEE. Even if the electric function is only a minor element of the equipment, the definition still applies.\n\nIndicative examples of such EEE are:\n\n <sup>19</sup> European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste.\n\n- a gas cooker with an electrical clock;\n- a singing teddy bear; sport shoes with lights;\n- petrol powered equipment with an electric spark for ignition, like lawnmowers.\n\nIn all these cases the electric function is an intended and integral part of the product's functionality, and the full functionality of the equipment is at least impaired (i.e. it does not work properly) if that electrical function fails. It is irrelevant where the electricity comes from, or if it is the main energy source.\n\nIn order for a product to be EEE, its electricity dependent functions must in principle be integrated.\n\nFor the example of a wardrobe with lights, even if sold as a single unit, a distinction between the piece of furniture and the electric/electronic device the piece is or can be equipped with has to be drawn. If the lighting is EEE in itself and both the lighting and the wardrobe can be separated and used as fully functional separate products, only the electric/electronic equipment (the lighting) is in the RoHS 2 scope. The furniture itself would then be outside the scope.\n\nThis scenario is different from the example of power tools, lamps and many other types of EEE, most of which are already in the scope of RoHS 1 and are comprised of various detachable electric/electronic and non-electric/electronic parts, which are however only fully functional in combination. These parts are simply integral parts of EEE and have to meet the respective requirements. This is for example reflected in various existing exemptions for non-electric EEE parts.\n\nThe substance restrictions of article 4 apply to the whole equipment. All equipment placed on the market and meeting the definition of EEE is in the scope of RoHS 2 under one of the 11 categories in the new Annex I, unless it is otherwise excluded from scope in Article 2(4).\n\n## *Q7.2 What does dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields mean?*\n\nDependent on electrical currents or electromagnetic fields means that such currents and fields pass through the electrical or electronic parts of the EEE to fulfil at least one function. Equipment without any electrical or electronic parts such as compact discs (CDs) and optical cables are outside the scope of RoHS 2.\n\n#### *Q7.3 Do components have to comply with RoHS 2?*\n\nRoHS 2 provides that EEE has to meet the requirements of the Directive. Since **equipment consists of different components**, the EEE itself can only meet the substance requirements if all its components and parts meet the substance restriction requirements of RoHS 2, including non-electronic or non-electric components like fasteners or the plastic case of a desktop computer. Therefore components being used in finished EEE or for repair or upgrade of used EEE, which is in the scope of RoHS 2 must meet the **substance restrictions according to Art. 4 but do not need CE marking.** Components sold as a stand-alone components or if produced to be used in a product benefiting from an exclusion do not have to be CE marked and do not have to comply with the substance requirements.\n\n#### *Q7.4 Are consumables in the scope?*\n\nOnly consumables with an equipment constituent meeting the now more specific definition of EEE in Article 3(1) and 3(2) such as printer cartridges are EEE and in the scope of RoHS 2.[20](#page-18-0) Consumables that do not meet the definition of EEE (Q7.1), such as soap powder or vacuum cleaner bags, are not equipment and are therefore not in the scope of RoHS 2.\n\n# **8. CE Marking, Conformity Assessment Procedures including Required Technical Documentation and Declaration of Conformity**\n\nThe following section covers **specific points relating to RoHS 2** and should be read in conjunction with the Blue Guide[21.](#page-20-0) The remarks on CE marking requirements refer exclusively to RoHS. CE marking may (also) be required on the basis of other applicable legislation, e.g. Low Voltage directive, EMC, R&TTE, Machinery etc.\n\n# *Q8.1 What is the New Legislative Framework?*\n\nTo remove obstacles to the free circulation of products and to create an efficient and coherent European legal framework with regard to the marketing of products the Commission in 1985 introduced the \"New Approach\" which was further developed in 1990 by the \"Global Approach\". The New Legislative Framework[22](#page-20-1) (NLF) constitutes the modernisation of the New and the Global Approach. Regulation 765/2008 sets out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products[23](#page-20-2). Decision 768/2008 sets a common framework for the marketing of products. This includes model provisions to support market surveillance and the application of CE, the marking, definitions of terms commonly used in product legislation (but sometimes used differently at present) and procedures that allow future sectoral legislation to become more consistent and easier to implement. The decision is only binding upon the EU institutions. To be operational, the model provisions of the Decision need to be incorporated into existing Directives when they are next revised. This process is known as \"alignment\".\n\nOverall, the objective of the NLF is to help the internal market for goods work better and to strengthen and modernise conditions for placing a wide range of products on the EU-market. The package of measures within the NLF\n\n- improves the market surveillance rules, to better protect both consumers and professionals, including imports from third countries;\n- boosts the quality of the conformity assessment of products through clearer and stronger rules on the requirements for the notification of assessment bodies;\n\n <sup>20</sup> According to the RoHS 1 FAQs, all consumables were outside the scope of RoHS 1. Products newly\n\n<span id=\"page-20-3\"></span><span id=\"page-20-0\"></span><span id=\"page-20-3\"></span><span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>in scope such as printer cartridges therefore benefit from the Article 2(2) grace period. <sup>21</sup> [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/files/blue-guide/guidepublic\\\\_en.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/files/blue-guide/guidepublic_en.pdf) [22http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/regulatory-policies-common-rules-for](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/regulatory-policies-common-rules-for-products/new-legislative-framework/)[products/new-legislative-framework/](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/regulatory-policies-common-rules-for-products/new-legislative-framework/)\n\n<span id=\"page-20-2\"></span><span id=\"page-20-1\"></span><span id=\"page-20-2\"></span><span id=\"page-20-1\"></span>[<sup>23</sup>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:218:0030:0047:en:PDF](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:218:0030:0047:en:PDF)\n\n- clarifies the meaning of CE marking; and\n- establishes a common legal framework for industrial products in the form of a toolbox of measures for use in future legislation.\n\n# *Q8.2 What is a Declaration of Conformity (DoC)?*\n\nWhen a product is placed on the market the manufacturer or the authorised representative established within the EU are obliged to draw up an EU DoC as part of the conformity assessment procedure. This declaration must ensure that the requirements of the applicable Directive have been satisfied, i.e. with regard to RoHS 2 the electrical or electronic equipment is in compliance with the substance restrictions of RoHS 2. Pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Decision 768/2008/EC (common framework for the marketing of products) legislation requiring a DoC shall provide that a single declaration shall be drawn up in respect of all relevant Union Acts that apply. In light of this, single declarations should be encouraged.\n\n# *Q8.3 What do I need to include in my technical documentation?*\n\nArticle 7(b) of RoHS 2 requires the manufacturer to draw up the required technical documentation and carry out the internal production control procedure in line with module A of Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC (common framework for the marketing of products) or have it carried out on the manufacturer's behalf. Hence, the requirements for the technical documentation can be found in that same Annex II of the Decision under module A. CENELEC have produced a Harmonised European Standard on the required technical documentation[24](#page-20-3) for the presumption of conformity, which provides guidance to satisfy the requirements in 768/2008/EC.\n\n#### *Q8.4 How do I handle the transition to CE marking?*\n\nAll EEE within scope must be CE marked and include a reference to RoHS 2 (2011/65/EU) on the DoC from the date when the substance restrictions apply.[25](#page-21-0) Where EEE falling within the scope of RoHS 2 and meeting the substance restrictions, procedural requirements and other requirements is placed on the market on or after the Directive's entry into force date (21 July 2011), it may be CE marked and include RoHS 2 on its DoC even if the substance restrictions do not yet apply.\n\n#### *Q8.5 Do spare parts and sub-assemblies need to be CE marked and have a DoC?*\n\nArticle 3 distinguishes between EEE (Article 3(1)) and spare parts (Article 3(27)). Article 4 requires EEE and spare parts to comply with the substance restrictions but the requirements for affixing CE marks under Article 15 only apply to finished EEE. Therefore spare parts that are not finished EEE (Article 3(1)) do not have to be CE marked or have a DoC. Spare parts are not finished EEE when they are marketed for the repair, reuse, updating or upgrading of specific EEE.\n\nProducts that are finished EEE such as some graphic cards need to be CE marked and have a DoC. The same also applies to sub-assemblies, except for subassemblies that are supplied for further integration into EEE by a manufacturer or\n\n<span id=\"page-21-1\"></span><span id=\"page-21-1\"></span> <sup>24</sup> EN50581:2012: Technical documentation for the assessment of electrical and electronic products with respect to the restriction of hazardous substances.

For the purposes of Article 2(2), non-compliant not only means that these products do not need to comply with the substance restrictions but also with the procedural requirements under RoHS 2, including DoC and CE marking. Therefore, although there is no transitional phase for the DoC and CE marking, categories 8 and 9 equipment does not need to be CE marked or include 'RoHS 2' on the DoC until the substance restrictions apply. Other EEE outside the scope of RoHS 1 and inside the scope of RoHS 2 will not require CE marking or a DoC for RoHS 2 unless placed on the market from 23 July 2019.\n\n#### *Q8.7 How do I know if a product is already compliant with the substance restrictions, if the transition period is still ongoing?*\n\nThe information on whether EEE that\n\n- is still subject to the transitional period under RoHS 2 **and**\n- is bearing a CE mark\n\nis already compliant with the substance requirements will be found in the DoC.\n\n#### *Q8.8 In terms of CE marking, is \"finished product\" (Article 7(c)) and \"finished EEE\" (Article 15(1)) the same?*\n\nYes. The Blue Guide (page 15) gives additional guidance on this and suggests that for the purposes of the directive terms such as 'electrical and electronic equipment' can be read as 'electrical and electronic product' where this aids clarity of meaning. Therefore, for the purposes of Article 7 and Article 15 the terms product and EEE should be considered to have the same meaning and be interchangeable.\n\n#### *Q8.9 If RoHS 2 applies to a whole product, should I prepare a DoC and CE related technical documentation for the non-EEE part?*\n\nThe DoC should reference the product as placed on the market under Article 4. This would normally be the model number or similar description of the whole product as placed on the market.\n\nRoHS 2 applies to the equipment and all its constituent parts, for example an electric power tool sold together with adjusting tools and case. However, RoHS 2 does not apply to any manuals, documentation, consumables etc. that do not have an equipment constituent as well as any packaging intended to be discarded soon after putting the equipment into service. Technical documentation required by Article 7(b) should include compliance information on all constituent parts of the product as described above.\n\n#### *Q8.10 How can Harmonised Standards be used to demonstrate compliance?*\n\nThe Blue Guide (4.3, page 29) gives guidance on the presumption of conformity including the use of harmonised standards.\n\n#### *Q8.11 What does a CE mark on EEE mean with regard to the restricted substances?*\n\nCE marking symbolises the conformity of the product with the applicable EU requirements imposed on the manufacturer. The CE marking affixed to a product therefore is a declaration by the person responsible that\n\n- the product conforms to all applicable EU provisions, and\n- the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out.\n\nFrom 2nd January 2013 EEE in scope that bears a CE marking is presumed to be in conformity with the requirements of RoHS 2 and therefore is presumed not to contain more than the tolerated maximum concentration values as mentioned in Annexes II, III and IV of RoHS 2.\n\n#### *Q8.12 Can I have any RoHS marks other than the CE mark?*\n\nFrom 2nd January 2013, CE marking shall be the **only** marking which attests the conformity of the product with the requirements of RoHS 2. Pursuant to EC/765/2008 markings, signs or inscriptions that are likely to mislead third parties regarding the meaning or form of the CE marking shall be prohibited.\n\n#### *Q8.13 Considering the time span between a product being placed on the market and being examined by a distributor, when does the product need to be in compliance with this directive?*\n\nThe product needs to be compliant with the requirements, including identification information, that are applicable at the time of its 'placing on the market' (by the manufacturer or importer). It can thereafter continue to be made available by economic operators in the distribution chain. However, this does not refer to the end of the Article 2(2) grace period for non-compliant products; see Q2.1.\n\n#### *Q8.14 What are the product marking requirements for traceability reasons?*\n\nArticle 7 requires manufacturers to mark equipment with type, batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification. The frequency of marking, whether it is for a product line, batch or individual serial numbers is a matter for business decision.\n\nWhere identified non-conformities require action on the part of economic operators, product identification may be used to establish the action required to mitigate that nonconformity and to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant EEE on the market.\n\n# **9. Substance Restrictions and Exemptions**\n\n#### *Q9.1 What is the difference between RoHS 1 and RoHS 2 regarding requirements for exemption?*\n\nSeveral changes with regard to the requirements for exemptions in RoHS 2 have been introduced. These changes are related to procedural aspects as well as the criteria for assessing applications for exemptions. The new procedural aspects are:\n\n- Manufacturers who apply for exemptions have to comply with the minimum requirements in Annex V.\n- Deadlines for the Commission for granting, renewing or revoking an exemption are set. Furthermore deadlines for manufacturers for the application for renewal of an exemption are set.\n- Transitional measures in case exemptions are not renewed or revoked are defined.\n\nIn addition to the two criteria for the assessment of exemptions in RoHS 1 (i.e. practicability, and whether the environmental, health and consumer safety impacts of substitution are negative compared to the use of the restricted substances), a third criterion has been added under RoHS 2. Hence, in the future it also has to be assessed whether the **reliability of the substitutes is ensured**. An exemption can only be granted if at least one of the three criteria justifies the specific use of a restricted substance. Please note that the impact criterion has changed from RoHS 1 to RoHS 2. With RoHS 2, if the overall impact of substituting a restricted substance were negative, this would then justify its exemption.\n\nAdditionally, the following parameters have to be taken into account:\n\n- availability of substitutes (new)\n- socio-economic impact of substitution (new)\n\nThis means that an exemption cannot be based on these parameters only. These are not considered to be as significant as the three criteria mentioned above. If a criterion is fulfilled, the parameters may subsequently influence the decision-making.\n\nWith regard to applications for exemptions, these may be submitted by a manufacturer, authorised representative of a manufacturer, or any economic operator in the supply chain as before. Furthermore the maximum exemption duration has been changed and is now to be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExemptions are listed in two annexes in RoHS 2:\n\n- Annex III: applications exempted from the restrictions on substances, concerning all EEE falling into the scope (including medical devices and monitoring and control instruments)\n- Annex IV: applications exempted from the restrictions on substances, specific to medical devices and monitoring and control instruments\n\nExemptions are now granted for a maximum validity period, and may be renewed only on request (application for renewal) after a case-by-case assessment.\n\n## **RoHS 2 Exemptions – maximum validity periods**\n\n| Exemptions<br>EEE<br>categories | Exemptions listed in Annex III as at 21 July 2011 |                                | Exemptions listed in Annex IV as at 21 July 2011 |                                |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                 | Expiry date specified                             | No expiry date specified       | Expiry date specified                            | No expiry date specified       |\n| Categories 1 to 7 and 10        | 22 July 2011 – specified date                     | 22 July 2011 –<br>21 July 2016 | Not applicable                                   | Not applicable                 |\n| Categories 8 and 9 general      | 22 July 2014 – specified date                     | 22 July 2014 –<br>21 July 2021 | 22 July 2014 – specified date                    | 22 July 2014 –<br>21 July 2021 |\n| Category 8 in vitro*            | 22 July 2016 – specified date                     | 22 July 2016 –<br>21 July 2023 | 22 July 2016 – specified date                    | 22 July 2016 –<br>21 July 2023 |\n| Category 9 industrial*          | 22 July 2017 – specified date                     | 22 July 2017 –<br>21 July 2024 | 22 July 2017 – specified date                    | 22 July 2017 –<br>21 July 2024 |\n\n\\* Information about the specified use of exemptions (category 8 in vitro or category 9 industrial) shall be found in the documentation accompanying an application for exemption.\n\nExemptions listed on annex III and IV will no longer be generally applicable when:\n\n- Their validity period has expired;\n- They are revoked because the conditions set out in article 5(1)(a) are no longer fulfilled (anyone can apply for revocation assuming they have documentation that can justify it).\n\n## **Q9.2** Are exemptions granted per company, equipment or application?\n\nExemptions are granted for specific substances used in specific applications and not for the whole EEE, nor for a company. Therefore, whoever uses the substances in the specific application can benefit from the exemption.\n\n#### **Q9.3** Is it possible to check if an exemption has been applied for?\n\nYes, once a stakeholder consultation has been announced. All information on applications for exemptions from requirements in RoHS 2 can be found at <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs\\_eee/events\\_rohs1\\_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs\\_eee/events\\_rohs1\\_en.htm</a>.\n\n## Q9.4 How will recent exemptions granted under RoHS 1 apply to RoHS 2?\n\nThe recent exemptions granted under RoHS 1 in 2011/534/EU<sup>26</sup> apply until 3 January 2013 but still need to be legally incorporated under RoHS 2 in order to apply afterwards.\n\n<span id=\"page-25-0\"></span><span id=\"page-25-0\"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>26</sup> COMMISSION DECISION of 8 September 2011 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications containing lead or cadmium. Two Commission Delegated Directives pursuant to RoHS 2 Article 5 covering these exemptions are currently under Council and Parliament's scrutiny.\n\n#### *Q9.5 Does the exclusion granted by Article 4(4)(f) apply to all expired exemptions, irrespective of whether or not the text in Annex III or IV explicitly confirms this point?*\n\nYes, the exclusions granted by Article 4(4)(f) are not limited to those explicitly confirmed in Annex III or Annex IV.\n\n#### *Q9.6 What are the maximum concentration values for the restricted substances, and how do I make sure that my EEE complies?*\n\nThe maximum concentration values referred in Article 4(2) are listed in Annex II to RoHS 2. For lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), the maximum concentration is 0.1 % by weight in all homogeneous materials in the EEE. For cadmium, the corresponding maximum concentration is 0.01 % by weight in all homogeneous materials in the EEE.\n\nThe Harmonised European Standard[27](#page-25-0) EN 50581:2012 specifies technical documentation the manufacturer may compile in order to demonstrate compliance with the substance restrictions in RoHS 2. The technical documentation shall also be in line with Module A in Annex II to Decision 768/2008/EC. The standard should therefore be read in conjunction with Module A.\n\nMember States may still carry out analysis of such EEE as part of their enforcement activities. If such analysis shows a violation of the substance restrictions, the manufacturer of the EEE bears the full responsibility for this despite having assessed the EEE according to the standard.\n\n#### *Q9.7 Do the substance restrictions apply to the production process?*\n\nNo. The restrictions only apply to finished EEE. The restricted substances may therefore be used in the production process, as long as they do not violate other regulations and the finished EEE does not contain the substance above the maximum concentration values.\n\n## *Q9.8 What is a homogeneous material?*\n\nA homogeneous material is either:\n\n- 1) A material with a uniform composition throughout; or\n- 2) A material that consists of a combination of materials, that cannot be disjointed or separated into different materials by mechanical actions such as unscrewing, cutting, crushing, grinding or abrasive processes.\n\nExamples of homogeneous materials include a plastic cover to a computer screen, a copper wire inside a cable, and the solder part of a solder joint.\n\nAll EEE consist of many different homogeneous materials and the maximum concentration values are applied to each of the homogeneous materials **individually**.\n\nAny sample taken from EEE by a Member State enforcement authority should not contain the restricted substances above the maximum concentrations unless there is an applicable exemption. Due care and risk considerations should be taken when preparing samples for compliance assessment purposes to assure individual\n\n<span id=\"page-26-0\"></span><span id=\"page-26-0\"></span> <sup>27</sup> See also question 8.3.\n\nhomogeneous materials are adequately separated where homogenising samples may dilute the presence of the restricted substances for the test method applied.\n\n# Q9.9 Are there simple methods for the analysis of hexavalent chromium in coatings?\n\nAnalysis of hexavalent chromium (CrVI) as % by weight is difficult, whereas a simple, reliable and very sensitive method is available for analysis of CrVI in passivation coatings, which gives results as  $\\mu$ g/cm2. To convert these values to % requires knowledge of the coating's thickness and density. Coating thickness is not usually known and most electrical equipment manufacturers do not have the equipment or expertise to measure thickness accurately. Density is not known but could be assumed as ~5.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\nPassivation coatings that are used for electrical equipment are essentially of two types. Either: i) intentionally contain hexavalent chromium at ~10% of the coating (e.g. in yellow or olive coatings) or ii) CrVI is not intended to be present such as in trivalent coatings where CrVI should be present at <0.1%. If the coating density and thickness (based on colour and type) were assumed, then a reasonable estimate of CrVI concentration could be made from the result of the hot water extraction test. This estimated result will usually be much larger than 0.1%CrVI for coatings with intentionally CrVI coatings and will usually be <0.1% if CrVI is not intended to be present, although exceptions do occur. If borderline results are obtained then coating thickness can be measured so that more accurate CrVI concentrations could be calculated but this would be expected to be necessary only in a small percentage of tests.\n\n# Q9.10 How thick does a coating have to be in order to be a homogenous material?\n\nThe RoHS definition of homogeneous materials is that if two materials, such as two layers of a coating, can be separated by physical methods, then these are two different homogeneous materials. Types of coatings used in EEE that are thinner than 100 nm rarely contain RoHS restricted substances, except for some thin passivation coatings. It is therefore possible to exclude these thin coatings from the necessity to analyse.<sup>28</sup>\n\n#### Q9.11 What is \"closed-loop\"?\n\nUnder Article 4(5), spare parts recovered from EEE placed on the market before RoHS 1 entered into force on 1 July 2006, and reused in new EEE placed on the market before 1 July 2016, are exempt from the substance restriction provided that their reuse takes place in an \"auditable closed-loop business-to-business return system\". This means that spare parts containing the restricted hazardous substances at levels above the maximum concentration may only be resold to other businesses and only within a system where all transfers are registered, documented and tracked. (That is, it should not be sold on the \"regular market\") Furthermore, both the buyer and the end user should be informed about the reuse of parts, including the risk of hazardous substance content. This could for example be indicated on the packaging.\n\n<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>28</sup> For more background information regarding questions 9.9 and 9.10 see BioIS/ERA final report pages 28-57: <u>http://rohs.biois.com/product-group-factsheets</u>."

Economic operators may include:\n\n- Manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment and parts thereof\n- Representatives authorized to act on behalf of manufacturers\n- Distributors of electrical and electronic equipment\n- Importers of electrical and electronic equipment\n\n<span id=\"page-4-1\"></span><span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>\n\n## **1.2 Do RoHS exemptions concern me?**\n\nThe 2011/65/EU Directive<sup>1</sup> (henceforth RoHS 2) restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment placed on the European market. If an article falls under the scope of equipment given in the RoHS 2 directive, it should be regulated accordingly, thus ensuring that it does not include one of the restricted substances above a prescribed amount. The regulated substances are listed in Annex 2 of the Directive as well as the maximum tolerated amount of the substance permitted in any homogenous material from which the application is comprised. At present the list of substances and tolerated values includes:\n\nLead (Pb), (0.1%)\n\n- Mercury (Hg), (0.1%)\n- Cadmium (Cd), (0.01%)\n- Hexavalent chromium (chromium VI, Cr+6), (0.1%)\n- Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), (0.1%)\n- Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), (0.1%)\n\nYou should be aware that legislation may provide for adjustments of the list of substances and/or tolerated amounts from time to time, in correspondence with available scientific and technological developments.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances came into force in January 2003 and was known as the RoHS directive. A recent recast in the form of Directive 2011/65/EU has brought into force the RoHS 2 regime, to which this document refers if not explicitly stating otherwise.\n\nHomogeneous material means a material that cannot be mechanically disjointed or separated into different materials, by use of actions such as unscrewing, cutting, crushing, grinding and abrasive processes. A few examples<sup>2</sup> are listed below:\n\n- A plastic cover is a \"homogeneous material\" if it consists of one type of plastic that is not coated with or has attached to it or inside it any other kinds of materials. In this case the limit values of the directive would apply to the plastic.\n- An electric cable that consists of metal wires surrounded by non-metallic insulation materials is an example of a \"non-homogeneous material\" because the different materials could be separated by mechanical processes. In this case the limit values of the directive would apply to each of the separated materials individually.\n- A semi-conductor package contains many homogeneous materials which include: plastic moulding material, tin-electroplating coatings on the lead frame, the lead frame alloy and gold-bonding wires.\n\nAnyone who is involved with the production of such an article, be it for purposes of putting such equipment onto the market, for research activities concerning substitutes or for (legal) services around these issues, should be aware of the RoHS Directive.\n\nIn most cases, it will be companies that want to have legal certainty for their products that will need to check whether an existing exemption either applies or whether a new or amended one should be pursued. Also, some companies or research institutions might be involved in developing substitutes and would hence like to increase the incentives for them to be used, which is why they may like to apply for the deletion of an exemption.\n\nIf you would like to check whether your application falls under the RoHS 2 scope, you may find some guidance within the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) draft from 15 June, 2012 mentioned in section [1.8](#page-14-1) of this document. Further questions may be referred to the European Commission by e-mail or post or to the national authorities.\n\nA list of national authorities can be found here:\n\n[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/contacts\\\\_ms\\\\_rohs.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/contacts_ms_rohs.pdf)\n\nIf you have found your application to be under the scope of RoHS 2, you may want to check if the criteria for exemption are applicable, to see if you have grounds for submitting a request for exemption. This should also be done if an exemption already exists but requires renewal or change of wording to cover additional similar applications, as well as in cases\n\n<sup>2</sup> Examples are cited from: European Commission Directorate General Environment, 2006, \"Frequently Asked Questions Document on Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the Use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) and Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)\", cf. under [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq\\\\_weee.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/faq_weee.pdf)\n\nwhere you would like to apply for the revoke of an exemption, due to recent scientific or technical developments.\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span><span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>\n\n### **1.3 Criteria for Exemptions**\n\nThe directive<sup>3</sup> includes a few criteria according to which RoHS 2 exemptions can be justified. This means that under specific circumstances, temporary permission, for placing EEE, which contains the RoHS 2 banned substances, on the EU market, may be granted. Such exemptions are then listed under Annexes III and IV of the directive. The following excerpt demonstrates how exemptions are listed in the directive annexes:\n\n|    | Exemption                                                                                                                                        | Scope and dates of applicability |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 33 | Lead in solders for the soldering of thin copper wires of 100<br>µm diameter and less in power transformers                                      |                                  |\n| 34 | Lead in cermet-based trimmer potentiometer elements                                                                                              |                                  |\n| 36 | Mercury used as a cathode sputtering inhibitor in DC plasma<br>displays with a content up to 30 mg per display                                   | Expired on 1 July 2010           |\n| 37 | Lead in the plating layer of high voltage diodes on the basis of<br>a zinc borate glass body                                                     |                                  |\n| 38 | Cadmium and cadmium oxide in thick film pastes used on<br>aluminium bonded beryllium oxide                                                       |                                  |\n| 39 | Cadmium in colour converting II-VI LEDs (< 10 µg Cd per<br>mm² of light-emitting area) for use in solid state illumination or<br>display systems | Expires on 1 July 2014           |\n\nTable 1: Excerpt of Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) Annex III\n\nIt should be noted that the criteria mentioned in the directive do not automatically justify an exemption but may rather be understood as the framework for your argumentation towards exemption justification. Assuming it can be shown that some of the criteria apply towards a certain application, the European Commission will still have the right of discretion in deciding if and under what circumstances the exemption should be granted.\n\nOne should also not assume that any single criteria can be seen as a minimum threshold that an exemption request must reach, but rather that respective argumentation towards the various points will be weighed and considered during the decision process.\n\nExemptions can be requested:\n\n First and foremost for applications, which contain RoHS 2 restricted substances above the amounts prescribed in Annex II of the directive (cf. section [1.2\\)](#page-4-1) – At present this is mainly relevant for applications previously considered out of scope and soon to be included, however if an in scope product is to newly be made available on the market\n\n<sup>3</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5(1)(a)\n\nor if you have just now recognized that your application is under the RoHS 2 scope it would also be relevant in your case.\n\n- In cases where a change of wording of an existing exemption could be made to include a similar application with the same inherent compliance issues\n- In cases where an exemption exists but is due to expire within ca. 18 months.\n\nYou should keep in mind that the scope of RoHS was changed in the last recast and it is possible that an application that was previously exempt is now included in the scope. In such cases, a product that is already available on the market might require undertaking action for the approval of an exemption. Furthermore, the existing list of exemptions and the scope of RoHS 2 are always subject to changes. As a company you are always in the duty of keeping yourself updated in this respect and of verifying whether action is needed.\n\nThe directive states<sup>4</sup> that exemptions may also be deleted from the Annexes if the conditions established through applicable criteria are no longer fulfilled. A request for deletion would then argue that the various criteria are no longer met. This could be relevant for you if your enterprise has developed or is representing a developer of possible substitutes for an application currently exempt.\n\nThe following diagram will take you through the various criteria, to help you understand if you have grounds for requesting an exemption for your application.\n\nThis diagram may also be of assistance if you would like to apply for the renewal of an exemption that is close to the end of its validity; to apply for changing the wording of an ongoing exemption so that it may cover additional similar applications or; to apply for the deletion of an existing exemption.\n\n<sup>4</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5(1)(b)\n\nImage /page/8/Figure/2 description: Figure 1 shows a flowchart outlining the grounds for establishing if a product or article may qualify for a temporary exemption. The flowchart begins with the question, \"Will exemption weaken environment and health protection afforded by REACH?\" If the answer is \"Yes,\" the criteria for exemption do not apply. If the answer is \"No,\" the flowchart proceeds to \"Check Technical and Environmental Criteria.\" The next question is, \"Is substitution scientifically or technically impracticable?\" If the answer is \"Yes,\" the criteria for exemption do not apply. If the answer is \"No,\" the flowchart asks, \"Substitute is unreliable.\" If the answer is \"Yes,\" the criteria for exemption do not apply. If the answer is \"No,\" the flowchart asks, \"Are negative social, health and consumer safety impacts of substitution > benefits?\" If the answer is \"Yes,\" the criteria for exemption do not apply. If the answer is \"No,\" the flowchart proceeds to \"Additional Criteria that may apply.\" The flowchart then asks, \"Could substitution bring about significant socio-economic advantages?\" followed by \"Is the substitute readily available?\" and \"Does Life Cycle assessment support substitution?\" If the answer to any of these questions is \"No,\" then \"An exemption should be applied for.\"\n\nThe directive also requires that impacts of an exemption on future innovation be considered when deciding on the duration of exemptions.\n\n[Table 2](#page-8-0) below contains some further information as to how the various criteria should be understood:\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>Table 2: Definition of RoHS 2 exemption criteria\n\n| Element                                                                                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Threshold Criteria                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Element                                                                                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Exemption may weaken REACH afforded<br>environmental and health protection                                 | An exemption may weaken REACH afforded environmental and<br>health protection where REACH regulation already includes<br>restrictions for the use of the substance in the application in<br>question.

Use the checklist below to understand what information and data you need to compile before handing in a request.\n- 2. Fill out the application form (see appendix 1)\n- 3. Send the application form along with further documentation to the European Commission by e-mail or post:\n\nContact details:\n\nRoHS Policy Officer European Commission DG ENVIRONMENT Unit ENV/A2 Waste Management & Recycling Avenue de Beaulieu(BU)9 05/106 B-1160 Brussels/Belgium Email: [ENV-ROHS@ec.europa.eu](mailto:ENV-ROHS@ec.europa.eu)\n\n4. Be ready to answer questions related to your request.\n\n#### *Checklist Documentation*\n\nResearch and provide documentation such as:\n\n- Test results on the suitability of substitutes and any other technical / scientific documentation supporting your request – If possible and available this documentation should be third party certified.\n- Third party verified documentation such as life cycle assessment according to ISO 14040, ISO 14044, PCF, CBA etc.\n- Roadmaps for the further technical development of RoHS 2 compliant substitute applications.\n- REACH-relevant documentation such as registration, application for authorization etc.\n- Documentation from suppliers on the availability or non-availability of substitutes\n- Socio-economic data in as much detail as possible (see application form in Appendix 1 for the necessary categories and level of detail) and if possible and available, with third party certification.\n\n## **1.5 What happens once I apply for an exemption?**\n\nOnce you have handed in your request it will be processed in a standardized manner which is briefly described in this section.\n\nFirst of all the request will be subject to a first check by the European Commission. Then the request will be technically and scientifically evaluated (this may be prepared by an external consultant). Finally the request will go through a formal procedure within the EU institutions, in which a decision shall be made concerning it approval.\n\nThe directive<sup>5</sup> describes in detail the procedure stages that need to be followed concerning requests for exemptions. These include:\n\n(a) The Commissions will acknowledge receipt of an application in writing within 15 days of its receipt. The acknowledgement shall state the date of receipt of the application;\n\n(b) The Commissions will inform the Member States of the application without delay and provide them with the application and any supplementary information;\n\n- (c) The Commissions shall make a summary of the application available to the public;\n- (d) The Commissions will evaluate the application and its justification\n\nThe evaluation of your request will include the following steps:\n\n- 1. Completeness check (duly filled out application format, availability of all necessary documentation, contact details available).\n- 2. First technical and scientific check (comprehension of request, validity of provided argumentation and information, identification of missing information).\n- 3. Compilation of questions to the applicant if necessary.\n- 4. Once the requested additional information has been received, the submitted information will be prepared for an online stakeholder consultation (compilation the application and additional information, references to former evaluations if applicable, questions to stakeholders, and preparation of consultation website). Note that a stakeholder consultation is usually held for a number of exemption requests in parallel and therefore will not necessarily take place adjacent to the completion of initial information.\n- 5. Minimum of 8 weeks online stakeholder consultation with the goal to collect additional data and information and to inform stakeholders about the request.\n- 6. Evaluation of consultation results and results of additional rounds of questions to the applicant and other stakeholders.\n- 7. Drafting of a recommendation including the evaluation results and a justification on whether the request should be accepted or not.\n\n<sup>5</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5 (4)\n\nOnce the recommendation has been prepared, the European Commission will have to decide whether it follows the recommendation which could lead to an amendment of Annex III or IV (cf. [Table 1\\)](#page-6-0). In this case, a draft Commission Delegation Regulation will be submitted according to the following steps:\n\n- (A) Preparation of legal measure;\n- (B) Consultation of Member States expert group for RoHS 2 delegated acts;\n- (C) COM internal consultation and translation;\n- (D) Notification of Council and Parliament;\n- (E) Publication of legal measure in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nIt should be noted that The European Parliament and the European Council may object to a delegated act, and so to the decision concerning an exemption within 2 months of notification. This period may be extended to up to 4 months.\n\n## **1.6 Everything you need to know about timelines for exemptions**\n\n### *How long do I need to wait for a decision concerning my application for exemption?*\n\nOnce you have handed in a request it may take up to one and a half years before the procedure has been completed. You thus need to hand in a request in due time to make sure that you have legal certainty as soon as possible in order to be able to put your product onto the market.\n\nThe directive<sup>6</sup> also lays down the obligation of the Commission to decide on an application for renewal of an exemption no later than 6 months before the expiry date of the existing exemption unless specific circumstances justify other deadlines. The existing exemption shall remain valid until a decision on the renewal application is taken by the Commission.\n\nIn case an exemption is to be deleted from the Annex, be it because the application for its renewal has been rejected or because the exemption is revoked, the directive<sup>7</sup> specifies that it shall expire at the earliest 12 months, and at the latest 18 months, after the date of the decision. I.e. a transition period is foreseen to allow stakeholders to take appropriate action.\n\nYou should consider how these timeframes may affect the production and the placing of application on the European market in deciding when at latest to submit an application for exemption, should applicable substitutes not be available.\n\n<sup>6</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5 (5)\n\n<sup>7</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5 (6)\n\n## When at latest should I apply for an exemption?\n\nIf you are applying for a <u>new exemption</u>, you should apply no later than 18 months (cf. above, section 1.3; procedure completion may take a year and a half) before your application comes under the RoHS 2 scope. You should additionally consider how much time you will need to adapt production processes for the use of substitutes, should your exemption not be approved, so as to avoid taking products off the market or postponing the distribution of a new application in the EU market.\n\nIf you would like to request the <u>renewal of an exemption</u>, the directive<sup>8</sup> sets the maximum time limit for the application for exemption renewal at no later than 18 months before the exemption expires.\n\nIf you would like to <u>change the wording of an existing exemption</u> you should take notice of the validity period as mentioned above, especially if there exist, within the exemption, a few clauses setting unique validity periods that depend on application specifics (for example voltage, size, material components, etc.).\n\nIf applying for the <u>revoke of an existing exemption</u>, you may apply immediately, so long as substitutes will be ready and approved for use in applications, should the request be approved. Though the procedure for reviewing and reaching a decision concerning a request may take up to 18 months, it could also take less and then an additional 12-18 months would be granted as transition period for manufactures to update production lines for the use of applicable substitutes.\n\n### How long will an exemption be valid?\n\nThe directive<sup>9</sup> regulates the maximum validity period of exemptions:\n\n| Category Annex I                                      | Maximum<br>validity period<br>for new<br>exemptions | Validity period for existing<br>exemptions where no<br>expiry date is specified | Validity period for existing exemptions where an expiry date is specified |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-7, 10, 11 (not applicable to<br>Annex IV exemption) | 5 years                                             | 22 July 2011 - 21 July 2016                                                     | 22 July 2011 - specified date                                             |\n| 8, 9 (medical and monitoring and control devices)     |                                                     | 22 July 2014 - 21 July 2021                                                     | 22 July 2014 - specified date                                             |\n| 8 (in vitro diagnostic medical devices)               | 7 years                                             | 22 July 2016 - 21 July 2023                                                     | 22 July 2016 - specified date                                             |\n| 9 (industrial monitoring and control instruments)     |                                                     | 22 July 2017 - 21 July 2024                                                     | 22 July 2017 - specified date                                             |\n\n Table 3:\n Maximum validity period of exemptions under RoHS 2 as of 21 July 2011 unless a shorter period is specified\n\n<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>8</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5 (5)\n\n<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>9</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU, article 5(2)\n\nAssuming that the conditions set out in the exemption criteria are still fulfilled, the validity period of an existing exemption may be renewed by means of application for renewal.\n\nYou should also be aware that if your application is to be included into the RoHS scope in the near future, the granted validity period only starts \"running\" once the application comes into scope.\n\n## **1.7 Application format and elaboration of necessary documentation for submitting an exemption request**\n\nThe application form can be found in the attachment below [### in final document it is perhaps better to add a link in case of updates ###]. It has been formulated to assist applicants in understanding the various details that should be included in an application.\n\nApplications should be submitted in digital format.\n\nIt should be specified if parts of an application, or parts of further information supplied throughout the evaluation process, are confidential. It is strongly recommended to submit confidential and non-confidential material in separate documents. Additionally, it should be noted that as confidential material cannot serve as official information in support of an exemption request (or its renewal, amendment or deletion), where possible, it should be refrained from.\n\n### **1.8 Further Resources**\n\nIn 2012 a RoHS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document draft was published by the European Commission. It includes information that may be of assistance concerning various issues such as:\n\n- The main changes introduced by the recast of RoHS (RoHS 2 regime)\n- Information concerning the transposition of the directive into force\n- Clarifications concerning the RoHS 2 scope, terms and definitions and other specific issues\n- Questions concerning compliance\n\nThe document may be found under:\n\n[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs\\\\_eee/pdf/faq.pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/pdf/faq.pdf)\n\n### **1.9 Attachment: Application Form**\n\n# **Exemption Request Form**\n\nDate of submission:\n\n# **1.

2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (recast)<sup>1</sup> (referred to below as 'the RoHS Directive' or 'the Directive'), the Commission must review the Directive no later than 22 July 2021<sup>2</sup> and present a report to the European Parliament and the Council. This document presents an evaluation of the Directive in line with the Commission's policy on better regulation. The results of this evaluation may feed into any subsequent proposal to revise the Directive<sup>3</sup> , and any non-legislative follow-up action.\n\nThe context is set by the European Green Deal<sup>4</sup> and the 2020 circular economy action plan<sup>5</sup> (CEAP). The Green Deal identifies electronics as a 'resource-intensive' sector, together with textiles, construction materials and plastics, while, in the CEAP, electronics are part of one of the seven key product value chains selected for action to increase circularity. The electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) sector is evolving fast, and its products are becoming more diverse and complex. EEE production and sales are increasing and at the same time the products' use phases are becoming shorter. This is generating an increasing volume of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), and creating an environmental challenge: how to disassemble and recycle complex products? The presence of certain hazardous substances in EEE prevents today's products from being recycled tomorrow and hampers circular economy ambitions. Furthermore, it poses risks to the environment and human health, especially when WEEE does not enter the designated disposal route, which is still too often the case. In addition, the current CEAP includes an action on '[reviewing] EU rules on restrictions of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and [providing] guidance to improve coherence [i.e. consistency] with relevant legislation, including REACH and Ecodesign'. Other relevant initiatives that set policy priorities have been taken into account, such as the chemicals strategy for sustainability<sup>6</sup> or the sustainable product policy<sup>7</sup> . Furthermore, in December 2022, an evaluation of the WEEE Directive<sup>8</sup> was launched (see details in chapter 2.2).\n\n<sup>1</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 88).\n\n<sup>2</sup> Whilst preparations for the general review started before 22 July 2021, the timetable was amended, to align it with other actions relating to sustainable products and chemicals listed in the European Green Deal.\n\n<sup>3</sup> Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the review of the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, COM(2023)760.\n\n<sup>4</sup> COM(2019) 640 final.\n\n<sup>5</sup> COM(2020) 98 final.\n\n<sup>6</sup> COM(2020) 667 final.\n\n<sup>7</sup> See also COM(2022) 142 final: proposal for a regulation on ecodesign for sustainable products.\n\n<sup>8</sup> Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 24, repealed by Directive 2012/19/EU of the European\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span><span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>\n\n## <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>1.2 Scope of the evaluation\n\nThis evaluation covers Directive 2011/65/EU including amendments<sup>9</sup> and its implementation in all EU Member States<sup>10</sup> , from the transposition deadline of 2 January 2013<sup>11</sup> until December 2022. Accordingly, this report analyses both issues relating to the legislation itself, and to its transposition and application in the Member States.\n\n<span id=\"page-7-1\"></span><span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>\n\n### <span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>1.3 Evaluation criteria covered\n\nIn line with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines12, this report assesses the Directive according to the following **five evaluation criteria.**\n\n- ✓ **Effectiveness.** How well has EU legislation achieved its objectives of (a) reducing hazardous substances in EEE in the EU and thus protecting human health and the environment at different stages of the value chain (e.g. production), and (b) contributing to the harmonisation and functioning of the internal market?\n- ✓ **Efficiency.** Have the obligations arising from the RoHS Directive been implemented in an economically efficient way and is there potential for further synergies to improve outcomes while minimising costs and administrative burden, including the impact on small and medium enterprises (SMEs)?\n- ✓ **Relevance.** Are the issues addressed by the RoHS Directive still relevant to current needs (e.g. new hazardous substances) and does the Directive help with issues addressed by wider EU policies on chemicals, circular economy, raw materials etc.? Is the Directive in line with the policy priorities and related initiatives adopted subsequently, as set out in the European Green Deal, the CEAP or, for example, in the chemicals strategy for sustainability13?\n- ✓ **Coherence.** How coherent (consistent) and connected is the RoHS Directive with EU-wide policy objectives on circular economy? What inconsistencies and overlaps might there be between the Directive and related legislation on hazardous substance restrictions, electronics and waste, such as Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 ('REACH Regulation') 14 , Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 ('POPs Regulation')<sup>15</sup> and Directive 2009/125/EC (Ecodesign) <sup>16</sup> measures?\n\n<sup>11</sup> In line with Article 25 of Directive 2011/65/EU.\n\nParliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (OJ L 197, 24.7.2012, p. 38).\n\n<sup>9</sup> The latest consolidated version of Directive 2011/65/EU encompassing 80 amendments is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02011L0065-20230301\n\n<sup>10</sup> NB: The United Kingdom was still a Member State of the European Union at the time of the stakeholder consultations related to this evaluation of the RoHS Directive.\n\n<sup>12</sup> SWD(2021) 305 final\n\n<sup>13</sup> COM(2020) 667 final.\n\n<sup>14</sup> Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1).\n\n<sup>15</sup> Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 7).\n\n<sup>16</sup> Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products (Text with EEA relevance) (OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, p. 10).\n\n✓ **EU added value.** What is the added value of the Directive compared to what Member States could have reached acting alone at national, regional and international level?\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>\n\n## <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>1.4 Evaluation process\n\nThe Commission's work on this evaluation was supported by an external contractor. The external study (referred to below as 'the evaluation study') was finalised in March 2021<sup>17</sup> . Most of the data presented here were taken from this evaluation study.\n\nIn March 2021, another study was launched to propose options to improve the deficiencies identified in the evaluation study and to assess their possible impacts. As it became apparent during the work that no full impact assessment is necessary, the work shifted to filling data gaps for the evaluation. This second support study ('second support study')<sup>18</sup> was published in May 2023. In order to have more complete results, this staff working document has been supplemented and therefore published later than originally planned.\n\nThe main steps undertaken, and sources of information used for this evaluation are presented in the following sub-sections. More information on the methodology and process followed for this evaluation (including on the consultation of stakeholders) can be found in Annex V.\n\n<span id=\"page-8-1\"></span><span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>\n\n### <span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>*1.4.1 Desk research*\n\nRelevant data and literature were identified, screened and reviewed, including: legal acts and documents relating to implementation of the Directive; exemption evaluation reports and reports on hazardous substance restrictions19; EEE statistics from Eurostat20; and relevant impact assessment studies.\n\n<span id=\"page-8-2\"></span><span id=\"page-8-2\"></span>\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-2\"></span>*1.4.2 Consultations*\n\nA number of stakeholder consultation activities took place.\n\n- − The Commission published an evaluation roadmap for the RoHS Directive in 2018, which was open for public feedback from 14 September 2018 to 12 October 2018 and received 20 responses<sup>21</sup> .\n- − An online public consultation (OPC) organised by the Commission was open for 12 weeks, from 13 September 2019 until 6 December 201922.

Most replies came from respondents in the UK (51 responses) and Belgium (32 responses), followed by Germany (25) and Japan (16). Almost half of the replies, 77, were from respondents outside the EU (Japan, UK, Switzerland, others)<sup>23</sup> .\n\n- − In parallel to the OPC, an in-depth survey (questionnaire) was shared with Member State authorities involved in implementing the RoHS Directive. A total of 20 responses were received, of which one was not counted in. Of the respondents, 13 completed the questionnaire fully, while 6 responded partially. Responses were provided by authorities from 15 Member States and Norway.\n- − Between October 2019 and March 2020, three focus group meetings were organised covering the following topics: (i) for Member States authorities regarding assessment of implementation and enforcement of the Directive, (ii) for NGOs regarding effectiveness and efficiency as well as environmental and health aspects, (iii) for business associations regarding effectiveness and efficiency as well as costs and benefits aspects and (iv) external and internal coherence.\n- − 15 in-depth interviews with targeted stakeholders (e.g. manufacturer, distributor, NGOs) were held, partly as follow-up to stakeholder input provided via the OPC.\n- − A virtual workshop was held in March 2020 to present the preliminary findings of the study and provide stakeholders with another opportunity to give input. Around 125 individuals joined the webinar. It brought together representatives from 12 Member States and 53 representatives from NGOs and industry. The organisations that had been interviewed and some people from the focus groups took part in the workshop. Moreover, prior to the workshop, 25 organisations sent contributions.\n\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span><span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>\n\n##### <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>*1.4.3 Quantitative analysis*\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of the RoHS Directive quantitatively, an evaluation 'baseline scenario' (in which the Directive was assumed not to exist) was established in the evaluation study. The analysis made it possible to estimate the amount of harmful substances which were avoided to be placed on the market.\n\n<span id=\"page-9-1\"></span><span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>\n\n# <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>1.5 Methodological limitations and robustness of findings\n\n<span id=\"page-9-2\"></span><span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>\n\n## <span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>*1.5.1 Stakeholder consultation*\n\n• The contribution from civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) was limited, including their participation in the dedicated focus group. This is due mainly to the lack of staff working on the RoHS Directive in those categories of stakeholders.\n\n<sup>23</sup> Through, at the time the OPC was open, the United Kingdom was still an EU Member State.\n\n- In the OPC, the vast majority of respondents were 'business organisations', which is understandable as the Directive concerns internal market harmonisation.\n- To mitigate the limited participation by NGOs, supplementary methods were used. For instance, on 12 December 2019, a focus group with NGOs discussed the Directive's effectiveness and efficiency with regards to environmental and health aspects.\n\n<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span><span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>\n\n### <span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>*1.5.2 Data limitations*\n\nDespite considerable efforts made during the evaluation process, data collection was inadequate in certain crucial respects, outlined below.\n\n- Data is lacking on the concentration of hazardous substances in EEE waste per category of product; sufficient data was not available on the weight of the 'homogeneous materials' in the EEE for which the maximum concentration values are regulated. Therefore, the model developed to determine the quantitative impact of the RoHS Directive on the quantities of hazardous substances in EEE is limited to mercury, lead and cadmium<sup>24</sup> .\n- Availability of data is limited for the period before and around implementation of the RoHS Directive, and for more recent years. The model developed to quantify the impacts of the RoHS Directive on the quantities of hazardous substances focused on the baseline and the period when the first RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) was in place.\n- It was not possible to collect precise information from the literature review or through interviews. Some of the stakeholders interviewed and focus group participants indicated that this could be due to the lack of a reliable monitoring framework before the first RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) and the possibility that sufficient amounts of RoHS-compliant EEE had not yet reached the end of their life cycle. Therefore, estimations and assumptions had to be made. For example, the concentration of hazardous substances in EEE components without an exemption were assumed to be 0% by weight, even though the maximum allowed threshold value would be higher under Annex II to the RoHS Directive.\n- It is almost impossible to relate a reduction in hazardous substances in EEE to one specific piece of legislation or initiative in a reliable manner. Over the years, other legislative developments and instruments have also had an impact on the use of RoHS-restricted substances. This includes the REACH Regulation at EU level, but also national initiatives.\n- As regards the data on costs and benefits:\n  - **-** companies were not able to provide precise data on the percentage of turnover spent on RoHS compliance, either in terms of their initial investment cost or operating expenditure;\n  - **-** some companies found it easier to provide full-time equivalent (FTE) estimates, the highest estimates having been provided by businesses representing EEE categories 3 ('IT and telecommunications equipment)', 8 ('medical devices')\n\n<sup>24</sup> Deca-BDE was considered, but insufficient data prevented further analysis and conclusions.\n\nand 9 ('monitoring and control instruments including industrial monitoring and control instruments) 25;\n\n- **-** there was sufficient data for an estimate of costs, but not for an overall assessment of the costs;\n- **-** due to the lack of precise data on the reduction in the amount of hazardous substances used in EEE, it was largely impossible to quantify the benefits in terms of reduction in hazardous substances on the market (see above).\n\nThe above data limitations have restricted the analysis substantially. Triangulation of sources was critical in making the findings more robust. Where primary data was not available, the evaluation relied on literature and experts' opinions. The report needs to be read with these caveats in mind; it cannot provide a precise assessment, but the findings reflect the order of magnitude of the impacts.\n\n# 2 WHAT WAS THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THE INTERVENTION?\n\n## 2.1 Objective of the intervention\n\nThe key objectives of the RoHS Directive are: to reduce the amount of hazardous substances in EEE to protect human health and the environment; and to facilitate the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE. The Directive also aims to ensure the functioning of the internal market<sup>26</sup> through harmonisation of Member State legislation<sup>27</sup> . Moreover, besides the key provisions on substance restrictions, the RoHS Directive also includes a number of provisions aimed at enabling the reuse and repair of EEE containing restricted substances, to help promote resource efficiency and circular economy objectives.\n\n## 2.2 Description of the intervention\n\nEEE is a highly diverse product group characterised by fast innovation cycles, which lead to continuous changes in equipment features, performance and materials used. EEE contains various substances that may present hazardous characteristics and thus pose a risk to the environment and to human health during the production and use of EEE, and the collection, treatment and disposal of waste EEE. Several Member States have addressed these problems by introducing national requirements.\n\nIn response to the challenges outlined above, in 2000, the European Commission proposed EU legislation to address human health and environmental concerns and to harmonise EEE-related legislation across Member States<sup>28</sup> . As a result, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2002/95/EC on the restriction of the use of\n\n<sup>25</sup> Annex I to the RoHS Directive lays down the 11 categories of EEE covered by this Directive.\n\n<sup>26</sup> Recital 2 of the RoHS Directive reads: 'The disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States regarding the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Union and may thereby have a direct impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It therefore appears necessary to lay down rules in this field and to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE'.\n\n<sup>27</sup> The RoHS Directive is also relevant for the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\n<sup>28</sup> COM(2000) 347, 2000/0159 (COD) (OJ C 365E, 19.12.2000, p. 195).\n\ncertain hazardous substances in EEE (the 'RoHS 1 Directive')<sup>29</sup> and Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (the 'WEEE Directive'). The latter sets rules for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of WEEE, to contribute to more sustainable production and consumption. However, even if WEEE were collected separately and sent for recycling, the hazardous substances it contained would likely pose a risk to health and the environment. Restricting the use of these hazardous substances is likely to increase the possibilities for WEEE recycling, to make recycling more profitable and to decrease the negative health impact on workers in recycling plants.\n\n## 2.3 Point(s) of comparison\n\nThe RoHS 1 Directive was revised in 2011, leading to the adoption of Directive 2011/65/EU. The aims of the revision/recast process were: (i) to improve the Directive in terms of implementation, enforcement and coherence; (ii) to review the measures provided for in the Directive, in particular with a view to including two additional categories<sup>30</sup> of equipment in the scope (categories 8 and 9: medical devices and monitoring and control instruments respectively); and (iii) to amend the list of restricted substances. The objectives of the revised Directive remained the same: to protect human health and the environment, to ensure environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE, and to ensure the functioning of internal market.\n\nThe key changes from Directive 2002/95/EC to Directive 2011/65/EU are summarised below.\n\n- The Directive's scope was gradually extended to cover all EEE, cables and spare parts31. The initial Directive specifically called for the scope to be reviewed in respect of EEE. The scope was then amended to strengthen the objectives of the Directive, in particular to promote a circular economy in the EU.\n- Provisions were added on regular reviewing of the list of restricted hazardous substances and amending them by delegated acts, to ensure consistency and coherence between different pieces of EU legislation.\n- The exemption mechanism was improved, with clearer and more transparent rules on granting, renewing or deleting exemptions and on exemption applications and required documentation.\n- Provisions were added to improve consistency with other EU legislation and especially with the New Legislative Framework<sup>32</sup> (e.g. CE marking and declaration of conformity) and REACH (for example, exemptions under Article 5(1)(a) and\n\n<sup>29</sup> Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 19).\n\n<sup>30</sup> There are 11 categories of electrical and electronic equipment listed in Annex I to the RoHS Directive.\n\n<sup>31</sup> As defined under Article 3(1) and (2) and not falling under the exclusions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2011/65/EU.\n\n<sup>32</sup> The New Legislative Framework set harmonised requirements for placing products on the EU market and was adopted in 2008. Some provisions in the RoHS Directive are due to the NLF. For more information: [https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/new-legislative-framework\\\\_en.](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/new-legislative-framework_en)\n\namendments to the list of restricted substances under Article 6(1) must be consistent with the respective REACH provisions).\n\n• At a later stage, the number of restricted substances was increased from six<sup>33</sup> to ten<sup>34</sup> .\n\nThe RoHS Directive evolved over time as both restricted substance coverage and product scope were enlarged, based on assessments<sup>35</sup> concluded in accordance with the Directive. The current Directive 2011/65/EU and its key operative provisions are described below.\n\n### *2.3.1 Scope*\n\nSince July 2019, the Directive has had an 'open scope', meaning that, unless explicitly excluded, any product that meets the definition of EEE as laid down in Article 3(1) of RoHS Directive falls within its scope.\n\nArticle 3(1) defines EEE as equipment which is dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly and equipment for the generation, transfer and measurement of such currents and fields and designed for use with a voltage rating not exceeding 1 000 volts for alternating current and 1 500 volts for direct current. According to Article 3(2), the term 'dependent' means 'with regard to EEE, needing electric currents or electromagnetic fields to fulfil at least one intended function'. As such, even equipment with a minor function dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields is considered an EEE.\n\nArticle 2(1) determines that the Directive applies to EEE falling within the 11 categories set out in Annex I to the Directive.\n\nArticle 2(4) provides various exclusions to the scope, for example:\n\n- large-scale stationary industrial tools;\n- large-scale fixed installations;\n- means of transport for persons or goods, excluding electric two-wheel vehicles which are not type-approved;\n- non-road mobile machinery made available exclusively for professional use; and\n- active implantable medical devices.\n\n### *2.3.2 Substance restrictions*\n\nThe central mechanism of the RoHS Directive is the substance restriction laid down in Article 4(1). Under this Article, Member States must ensure that EEE placed on the market, including cables and spare parts, does not contain hazardous substances (or their compounds) in concentrations above a specified limit value (by weight) tolerated in\n\n<sup>33</sup> Lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers were restricted under Directive 2002/95/EC.\n\n<sup>34</sup> The restriction of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) was introduced by Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2015/863 of 31 March 2015 amending Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of restricted substances, OJ L 137, 4.6.2015, p. 10.\n\n<sup>35</sup> Assessments, reports and studies concerning the review of Directive's scope and list of restricted substance are available a[t https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive\\\\_en#ecl-inpage-623.](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive_en#ecl-inpage-623)\n\nhomogeneous materials. The 10 substances currently restricted<sup>36</sup> are listed in Annex II to the RoHS Directive, along with their maximum tolerated concentration values. The restrictions cover whole substance groups like elementary mercury and all mercury compounds. This is in accordance with the whole life cycle approach and is meant to contribute to the simplicity of the restrictions.\n\nArticle 6(1) lays down a procedure for a periodic review of Annex II and specifies that the first review was due by July 2014. Subsequently, Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2015/863<sup>37</sup> added four phthalates to Annex II. The second paragraph of Article 6(1) contains criteria for the review and amendment of the list of restricted substances in Annex II. The first criterion is that amendments should be 'coherent' (consistent) with other legislation related to chemicals, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 ('REACH Regulation'). The Commission must also take special account of whether a substance, including items which consist of this substance and have a very small size or very small internal or surface structure, or a group of similar substances, could: have negative impact during EEE waste management operations, give rise to uncontrolled or diffuse release into the environment; lead to unacceptable exposure of workers; or be replaced by substitutes or alternative technologies (see Article 6(1), third paragraph). At the end of the process, the Commission should adopt delegated acts to amend Annex II.\n\n#### *2.3.3 Derogations and time-limited exemptions*\n\nFirstly, Articles 4(4) and 4(5) lay down several **derogations** from the substance restrictions in Article 4(1) which reflect the 'repair as produced' principle. Article 4(4) determines that the substance restrictions in Annex II do not apply to cables or spare parts for repairing, reusing or updating functionalities or for upgrading the capacity of a number of specified EEE categories. The dates which are linked to these derogations coincide with the dates of the scope extension to the new EEE categories<sup>38</sup> .\n\nIn addition, Article 4(5) determines that the substance restrictions do not apply to reused spare parts for specified types of EEE, provided that:\n\n- reuse takes place in auditable closed-loop business-to-business return systems;\n- the consumer is notified of reuse of spare parts; and\n- reused spare parts are recovered from EEE placed on the market before a specified date.\n\nThese derogations aim to facilitate the repair and reuse of EEE and therefore contribute to the EU's resource efficiency and circular economy objectives.\n\nFurthermore, Article 4(6) of the Directive allows **time-limited and application-specific exemptions** for applications listed in Annexes III and IV, to which the substance restrictions do not apply. The industry can submit applications for time-limited\n\n<sup>36</sup> Lead (0.1%), mercury (0.1%), cadmium (0.01%), hexavalent chromium (0.1%), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) (0.1%), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (0.1%), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (0.1%), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) (0.1%), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) (0.1%) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) (0.1%).\n\n<sup>37</sup> OJ L 137, 4.6.2015, p. 10-12.\n\n<sup>38</sup> For example, category 9 of Annex I, industrial monitoring and control instruments, came under the scope of RoHS in July 2017. Article 4(4)(e) exempts cables or spare parts for the repair, the reuse, the updating of functionalities or upgrading of capacity of industrial monitoring and control instruments placed on the market before 22 July 2017.\n\nexemptions. Annex III exemptions can apply to all EEE categories, while Annex IV lists applications specific to medical devices and monitoring and control instruments.\n\nArticle 5(1) defines the process and criteria whereby the European Commission includes or deletes EEE materials and components for specific applications in Annexes III and IV. This is the case where *any* of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n\n- elimination or substitution via design changes or materials and components which do not require any of the materials or substances listed in Annex II is scientifically or technically impracticable;\n- substitutes are not reliable; and\n- the total negative environmental, health and consumer safety impacts caused by substitution are likely to outweigh the total environmental, health and consumer safety benefits.\n\nThe availability of substitutes and the socioeconomic impact of substitution must also be taken into account. Decisions on the duration of any exemptions take into account any potential adverse impacts on innovation. Life cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the exemption should apply, where relevant. Amendments can only be made to Annexes III and IV through individual delegated acts.\n\nWhen assessing whether to add, amend or delete exemptions, the Commission requests external experts to evaluate exemption requests from industry and to assess if any of the criteria in Article 5(1)(a) is met. The exemption assessment consists of different phases, including a clarification, consultation, evaluation and reporting phase. In the process, several questionnaires are usually shared and at least one public online consultation is conducted, involving applicant, stakeholders and sector experts. Technical discussions are held at this stage to ensure transparency for all stakeholders. At the end of the process, the Commission's consultants provide it with a report including recommendations that the Commission considers when taking its decision.\n\nThe Annexes to the RoHS Directive currently contain 18 pages of time-limited detailed exemptions (as of December 2022)39, covering many different technical applications e.g. lighting equipment, medical devices, basic electrical components and lead-containing alloys used in EEE. Some exemptions have expired but remain for sake of clarity in the Annexes with their expiry date. Over time, exemptions that previously covered a wide scope of applications have been made more specific and, where possible, their scope has been limited to certain applications for which alternatives are not available or practical. This gives effect to a requirement reflected in Recital 19 to the Directive according to which, 'Exemptions from the restriction for certain specific materials or components should be limited in their scope and duration, in order to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in EEE, given that the use of those substances in such applications should become avoidable.' As a result, the technical complexity and level of detail of the exemptions have increased over time.\n\n<sup>39</sup> Some older exemption entries do not show an expiry date but have one based on the articles of the Directive.\n\n##### *2.3.4 Declarations of conformity and CE marking*\n\nThe main obligation in Article 4(1) of the RoHS Directive is incumbent upon the manufacturer of an EEE, defined<sup>40</sup> as 'any natural or legal person who manufactures an EEE or who has an EEE designed or manufactured and markets it under his name or trademark.' Manufacturers are to draw up the required technical documentation and carry out the internal production control procedure<sup>41</sup> .\n\nWhen these procedures demonstrate that EEE complies with the requirements, manufacturers draw up an EU declaration of conformity<sup>42</sup> and affix the CE marking<sup>43</sup> to the finished product. Additional obligations concerning record keeping and identification of EEE are also applicable. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, EEE bearing the CE marking are presumed to comply with the Directive.\n\n<sup>40</sup> Article 3(6) of the RoHS Directive.\n\n<sup>41</sup> Article 7 of the RoHS Directive.\n\n<sup>42</sup> In accordance with Article 13 of the RoHS Directive.\n\n<sup>43</sup> In accordance with Articles 14 and 15 of the RoHS Directive.\n\n# 3 HOW HAS THE SITUATION EVOLVED OVER THE EVALUATION PERIOD?\n\n## 3.1 Transposition of the RoHS Directive and delegated acts\n\nUnder Article 25 of the RoHS Directive, Member States must, by 2 January 2013, have adopted and published the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive and then communicated those provisions to the European Commission. All Member States have adopted legislation transposing the RoHS Directive into national law and most Member States have adopted legislation specifically focusing on hazardous substances in EEE.\n\nThe RoHS Directive has to date been amended by 80 Commission delegated directives 44 , many of which amend Annexes III and IV. In the consultation, many Member States said that amendments to the Directive are transposed through subsequent amendment of the national legislation, with some referring to 'dynamic links' in their national legislation (see chapter [4.1.5\\)](#page-31-0). Private stakeholders, mainly from the electrical and electronic business community, expressed concerns about the RoHS's effectiveness as a directive, rather than a regulation, which is seen as a more efficient legal form for handling the frequent updates. This issue is explored further in Section 4.\n\n## 3.2 Implementation and enforcement\n\nThe Directive's provisions on market surveillance are central to its implementation and enforcement. Article 18 requires Member States to carry out market surveillance in accordance with Articles 15 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020<sup>45</sup> . These Articles (Chapter III of the Regulation) outline the EU's market surveillance framework and checks on products entering the internal market. They require that each Member State designate a national authority which will be tasked with surveillance of the national market (here on the basis of the RoHS Directive and national implementing legislation).\n\nThe RoHS Directive refers in various provisions to the 'competent national authority', to whom economic operators <sup>46</sup> should send information and documentation to demonstrate that EEE complies with the Directive's requirements (Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10).\n\nMember States use different measures for checking compliance with the RoHS Directive. Checking that marking obligations are complied with is the simplest and most economical way. This document-based check typically focuses on checking that the CE marking is present and has been correctly applied, and that the declaration of conformity is present and valid. Although only four Member States clearly said they use this approach to market surveillance for the RoHS Directive, further feedback on non-\n\n<sup>44</sup> As at December 2022.\n\n<sup>45</sup> Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance and compliance of products amended Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, replacing Articles 15 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 by corresponding provisions. These amendments are applicable from 16 July 2021.\n\n<sup>46</sup> According to Article 3(10) of the Directive, 'economic operators' means the manufacturer, the authorised representative, the importer and the distributor.\n\nconformity issues suggested that this approach is widely used among Member States. More complex types of testing involve the use of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometers<sup>47</sup> by a number of Member States48, and, for certain substances, laboratory testing, used by at least five Member States<sup>49</sup> .\n\nAn administrative cooperation (AdCo) group supports enforcement of the Directive and helps to ensure it is applied consistently<sup>50</sup> . The group sometimes organises market surveillance joint actions, among other activities. For instance, in 2016, the RoHS AdCo group conducted a joint project on USB cables and contacts51. It aimed to assess compliance levels and to promote harmonised enforcement of the RoHS Directive across Europe. Results of risk-based checks have shown that, of the 157 products tested, 38 (24%) contained excessive levels of an RoHS-restricted substance, mainly lead in solders. Technical documentation was inspected for 18 products, and found to be noncompliant for 8 (44%). Labels on 109 of the 157 products were checked and 67 of these (61%) were non-compliant. Similar results were obtained in 2019 in tests on products with LED lamps and/or batteries; 25% of the products tested contained more than the tolerated maximum concentration of an RoHS-restricted substance<sup>52</sup> . Appropriate enforcement measures were taken by the relevant national authorities. Additionally, economic operators were informed of these results and referred to guidance on working preventively to comply with the requirements in the RoHS Directive.\n\nPrivate stakeholders expressed the view that the overall level of compliance with the Directive is satisfactory, and that its implementation mechanisms function as intended. However, enforcement activities reveal high non-compliance levels for some product categories. In addition, market surveillance authorities report that requests for further evidence of compliance from economic operators in the supply chain are often unsuccessful.\n\nIn the year 2012, the import of EEE was 2,75 times higher than the export of EEE from the EU53. Between 2014 and 2020 the monetary import of EEE increased<sup>54</sup> . This is relevant as market surveillance authorities reported practical difficulties in enforcing the provisions in cases of non-compliant imported EEE and in contacting authorities outside\n\n<sup>47</sup> XRF spectrometers are elemental analysers designed to detect inorganic elements such as chromium, bromine, cadmium, mercury and lead, in homogeneous polymeric materials.

The study also analysed non-compliance reports available in the EU Safety Gate Database<sup>56</sup> for 2013-2020, from which the following key points could be extrapolated for the RoHS Directive.\n\n- 1. The presence of lead in EEE is the most-frequently mentioned reason for noncompliance.\n- 2. For any given year, Sweden has the highest number of reports. This might be because Sweden takes a more stringent approach to market surveillance than other Member States, or because it has a greater propensity to file reports.\n- 3. China is by far the most cited country of origin for RoHS-non-compliant goods.\n- 4. The number of non-compliance reports submitted in 2019 is significantly higher than for all other years. This might reflect one or a combination of the following factors:\n  - a change in market surveillance approaches in Member States;\n  - a change in reporting approaches in Member States; and\n  - all else being equal, an increase in the number of non-compliant products.\n\nDifferent market surveillance approaches and methods of reporting non-compliance might bias the available data. Therefore, it is not possible to draw strong conclusions on the level of compliance with the Directive. In this regard, efforts are being made to harmonise methodologies and criteria for assessing risks and to strengthen consistency in different market surveillance activities under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020\n\n## 3.3 Interactions with other EU policies and legislation\n\nThe RoHS Directive has strong links to chemicals legislation like the REACH Regulation or the POPs Regulation. Substances can only be considered for inclusion on the list of restricted substances if inclusion would be in line with existing legislation. Amendments to the list of exemptions should not weaken the protection level afforded by the REACH Regulation. Those points are to be regularly taken into account by reviewing the list of restricted substances or the exemption list. In addition, scope exclusions and deviations from substance restrictions as the 'repair as produced' principle required special consideration to avoid inconsistencies between the different legislations.\n\nThe RoHS Directive is part of EU harmonisation legislation for manufactured products, and is therefore covered by its uniform framework for market surveillance.\n\n<https://ec.europa.eu/safety-gate-alerts/screen/webReport>\n\n<sup>54</sup> [Trade by commodity and NACE Rev. 2 activity \\[EXT\\\\_TEC05\\\\_\\\\_custom\\\\_2012768\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/0401aef1-1db2-4e10-b8b3-f5a9c47c16b2?lang=en)\n\n<sup>55</sup> Impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules and procedures for compliance with and enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products (2017) *[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:105e4f9b-e4b1-11e7-9749-](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:105e4f9b-e4b1-11e7-9749-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF) [01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC\\\\_1&format=PDF](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:105e4f9b-e4b1-11e7-9749-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF)*.\n\n<sup>56</sup> The Safety Gate system enables quick circulation of information about non-food dangerous products among the national authorities responsible for product safety in the single market countries.\n\nThe chemicals strategy for sustainability promotes a safe and sustainable-by-design approach and non-toxic material cycles, stating, '[…] it is necessary to ensure that substances of concern in products and recycled materials are minimised. As a principle, the same limit value for hazardous substances should apply for virgin and recycled material. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where a derogation to this principle may be necessary. This would be under the condition that the use of the recycled material is limited to clearly defined applications where there is no negative impact on consumer health and the environment, and where the use of recycled material compared to virgin material is justified on the basis of a case-by-case analysis*.'*\n\nClosely linked to the substance restrictions under the RoHS Directive are ecodesign requirements laid down by the Ecodesign Directive<sup>57</sup> and its implementing measures. Some products (e.g. fluorescent lamps) and their energy consumption are closely related to the use of hazardous substances and thus to RoHS requirements. To further reduce the negative environmental impacts of products over their lifetime, the Commission proposal for an ecodesign for sustainable products regulation (ESPR) would broaden ecodesign requirements and extend their scope<sup>58</sup> . Adoption of the proposed regulation and implementation through product–specific delegated acts will be of relevance to interaction with the RoHS Directive.\n\nLike the WEEE Directive, as explained in detail above, the RoHS Directive also interacts with many pieces of EU legislation on waste, such as Directive 2000/53/EC ('End-of-life Vehicles Directive').\n\n<sup>57</sup> Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products (OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, p. 10-35).\n\n<sup>58</sup> COM(2022) 142 final.\n\n# 4 EVALUATION FINDINGS\n\nThe Better Regulation Guidelines require evaluations to assess the **effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value**. To operationalise the assessment, an evaluation matrix was developed, which breaks the criteria down into evaluation questions (see Annex III). Results of the assessment are presented below, structured around three main guiding questions covering all the criteria.\n\n- To what extent was the RoHS Directive successful and why? (Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence)\n- How did the EU intervention make a difference? (EU added value)\n- Is the intervention still relevant? (Relevance)\n\n## 4.1 To what extent was the RoHS Directive successful and why?\n\n### Overall response\n\n*The RoHS Directive helped to reduce the relative amount of hazardous substances in EEE placed on the EU market and thus to protect human health and the environment. It contributed to WEEE treatment by reducing the level of hazardous substances per item of EEE in that waste stream. Consequently, there is reason to believe that waste management processes overall have become safer, although only limited quantitative evidence is currently available. The reduction in hazardous substances in WEEE is partially counterbalanced by the increasing volumes of WEEE generated in Europe.*\n\n*Furthermore, by providing for harmonised substance restrictions at EU level, the Directive produced economic benefits by creating a level playing field for businesses in the internal market, increasing legal certainty, and in some cases stimulating innovation through substitution. The Directive has also paved the way for RoHS-like legislation to be developed around the world.*\n\n*As for costs arising from the Directive, most appear to be linked to the exemption system and product development to comply with substance restrictions. However, businesses, and competent authorities in the Member States, found it difficult to dissociate the costs for RoHS from the costs linked to other compliance or enforcement activities related to EEE.*\n\n*Two coherence issues were identified for the Directive, both closely related to each other:*\n\n*• procedures for deciding on exemptions and review and amendment of the list of restricted substances, which were seen to have led to inefficiencies and administrative burden;*\n\n*• concerns regarding synergies and consistency in application between the RoHS Directive and related legislation (e.g. REACH, Ecodesign), including concerns about the coherence of approaches to substance evaluation.*\n\nThe success of legislation is measured largely by how well it meets its objectives. In this respect, the evaluation sought to identify:\n\n- the factors driving or hindering the RoHS Directive's progress in achieving its objectives (the Directive's *effectiveness*);\n- the extent to which the needs of the Directive are met in the most cost-effective ways (the Directive's *efficiency*) and with the least possible burden; and\n\n▪ whether the Directive is internally coherent and functions well in conjunction with other relevant legislation (the Directive's *coherence*).\n\nThe main conclusions of this analysis are set out below.\n\n#### *4.1.1 The RoHS Directive achieved its primary objective of restricting and thereby reducing the use of certain hazardous substances in EEE*\n\n#### The evaluation study findings suggest that the RoHS Directive contributed to a reduction in hazardous substances in EEE put on the EU market.\n\nThe evaluation study contained an analysis assessing the scale of the reduction in hazardous substances in EEE. Some assumptions had to be made here, and the used model was limited by the availability of quantitative data on the content and reduction in hazardous substances in EEE (see also chapter [1.5.2\\)](#page-10-0). The analysis assumed that economic operators in question complied with the Directive, even though as indicated in Chapter [3.2](#page-17-0) there may be a certain level on non-compliance in the EEE sector, which would result in higher amounts of hazardous substances in EEE.\n\nAs the impact of other legislative developments and instruments, such as the introduction of the REACH Regulation, could not be quantified, the reduction in hazardous substances in EEE cannot be attributed to RoHS alone. As an example, there are several acts restricting lead (e.g., in packaging<sup>59</sup> , batteries<sup>60</sup> , vehicles61), but they do not directly restrict hazardous substances in EEE although their positive effect could indirectly result from the fact that secondary material streams used for EEE manufacturing contain less lead due such restrictions. Other pieces of legislation do not directly restrict hazardous substances on environmental reasons but e.g. by introducing migration limits (e.g., under the Directive 2009/48/EC62) it is reasonable to expect a reduction of hazardous substances in articles including EEE. Besides legal requirements, it is expected that other initiatives/measures as labels/certificates, requirements for the public sector, financial incentives or internal company requirements have a significant impact on the reduction of hazardous substances in EEE (see also the second support study).\n\nThe quantitative analysis in the evaluation study estimates that, between the introduction of RoHS 1 in 2003 and 2016, restricted substances (cadmium, lead and mercury only) were reduced by around two thirds<sup>63</sup> . While the precise scale of the reduction cannot be\n\n- <sup>62</sup> Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys - OJ L 170, 30.6.2009, p. 1–37\n- <sup>63</sup> As presented in Appendix II to the evaluation study.\n\n<sup>59</sup> European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste - OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p.10.\n\n<sup>60</sup> Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC - OJ L 266, 26.9.2006, p.1.\n\n<sup>61</sup> Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles - OJ L 269 21.10.2000, p. 34.\n\nThe baseline estimations are based on the limited data available on the concentration of hazardous substances in a selection of products. These products and their concentrations have been used as proxies for their entire category.\n\ndetermined with certainty and estimates are not precise measurements, the finding that the concentration of hazardous substances in EEE declined with introduction of the RoHS 1 Directive is deemed valid.\n\nFor the other substances, i.e. hexavalent chromium, PBDEs, PBB and the phthalates, the second support study indicates a reduction in EEE over the years. Similar to the previous findings, it cannot be attributed to the RoHS Directive alone as many substances were about to be phased-out by other regulatory pressure and changed demands on the market.\n\nThe evaluation study also indicated that the average lifespan of EEE has decreased<sup>64</sup> . For instance, the lifespan of personal computers fell by more than 50% from 4-6 years in 1997 to 2 years in 2005<sup>65</sup> . In combination with the increase in electrified equipment (e.g. for 'smart homes'), this suggests that the number of products in the WEEE stream has been increasing, a finding supported by other sources66, 67, . For the EU, the WEEE stream has a current annual growth rate of 2%<sup>68</sup> .\n\nThe increasing volume of WEEE generated in Europe (see also [4.2.1.](#page-46-0)) is included in the quantitative analysis and it should be emphasised that this significantly offset the reduction in hazardous substances in WEEE in total.\n\nAnother shortcoming in the quantitative analysis is that the time-limited exemptions under the Directive were not considered. The exemptions cover a significant amount of hazardous substances. In the second support study a rough estimation of the most relevant exemptions for lead indicates a quantity of over 10 000 tonnes69, which shows the relevance.\n\nLooking at five applications, mostly relevant to categories 1-7 and 10 of Annex I, exempted since the adoption of the RoHS 1 Directive, valid for three different substances and subsequently renewed, an estimate suggests that for many exemptions, the volume of hazardous substances covered has fallen over time, but it was unclear whether this was related to the exemption system under the RoHS Directive. The amount of mercury in fluorescent lamps has been reduced over the years, partly due to the narrowing down the scope of the relevant exemptions. For one application concerning lead, there was no decrease in volume over the last 20 years. For another application, no reliable information was available on the volume of hazardous substance<sup>70</sup> .\n\n<sup>64</sup> Evaluation study: with latest estimates in 2012/2013.\n\n<sup>65</sup> Habib et al., 'What gets measured gets managed – does it?

According to stakeholders from the medical sector the reduction in hazardous substances in category 8 (medical devices) was small due to many justified exemptions. This is plausible as on the one hand, many exemptions for medical devices expired<sup>71</sup> and on the other, many new exemptions are listed in Annex IV of the Directive. For category 9 (monitoring and control instruments), the relevant association estimated that most hazardous substances (around 99%) were avoided comparing the years 2004 and 2019. This could not be confirmed in the evaluation study.\n\nFor category 11, a case-study on the United Kingdom suggests that e.g. 200 kg lead, 110 kg PBDE and 100 kg hexavalent chromium are saved between 2019 and 2025 by the inclusion of category 11 in the scope of the Directive.\n\nA decreasing trend of the amount of hazardous substances was suggested by stakeholder during the consultation activities. And in the OPC, most respondents among the expert stakeholders thought that the RoHS Directive was helping to reduce the use of hazardous substances in EEE produced both in and outside the EU [\\(Figure 1\\)](#page-24-0).\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/3 description: This image is a bar chart that shows the results of a survey asking whether the RoHS Directive has helped to reduce the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market. The survey was conducted among businesses & associations and others. For businesses & associations, approximately 70% said yes, approximately 2% said no, and approximately 12% said they don't know/blank. For others, approximately 13% said yes, approximately 1% said no, and approximately 1% said they don't know/blank.\n\n<span id=\"page-24-0\"></span><span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>**Figure 1: Expert OPC responses: reduction in use of hazardous substances in EEE (N=101)**\n\nIn the same OPC, Member States' representatives (N=15, 70% of all responses received) also gave a positive assessment of the effectiveness of the Directive. However, while in general most respondents thought RoHS had reduced the use of hazardous substances in EEE, they highlighted that it was difficult to provide a precise quantified estimate due to a lack of comprehensive data on the concentrations of hazardous substances in EEE.\n\nAs to *which* substances were reduced the most, expert stakeholders from businesses and associations (N=86, 75%) indicated in the OPC that the RoHS Directive had particularly impacted on the use of lead, mercury and hexavalent chromium in EEE, but less on other hazardous substances covered (see also Annex V).\n\n<sup>71</sup> Evaluation Study – For example, exemptions No. 21, 24, 28, 30, 32, 33 IIa, 38 under Annex IV\n\nThe quantitative analysis, with estimates for lead, mercury and cadmium, found that lead accounted for the largest part of the reduction. This is in line with lead's broad range of electrical and electronic applications, though some applications (e.g. in solders or alloys) are thought to be still covered by time-limited exemptions. For lead and mercury, the findings of the project 'urban mine platform' under the ProSUM Project<sup>72</sup> confirmed that there had indeed been a reduction. However, it was found that the amount of cadmium placed on the market had increased in recent years under this project, which conflicts with the results of the evaluation study.\n\n##### *4.1.2 Achieving a reduction in hazardous substances is expected to have positive effects on human health and the environment.*\n\nThe complex correlations between a reduction of hazardous substances and the effects on human health and the environment are difficult to quantify. Different legislation contributes to those effects and there are, after all, cumulative health and environmental benefits, which are described in a study<sup>73</sup> . The following conclusions can be drawn as to the magnitude of the **environmental effects** concerning the RoHS Directive.\n\n- The reduction in hazardous substances results in lower levels of harmful emissions during WEEE treatment and recycling processes, provided the WEEE is properly disposed of and treated. However, sound recycling practices need to be in place, so that emissions are carefully managed. Important requirements on limiting emissions, including emissions of restricted substances under RoHS, are laid down by Directive 2010/75/EU<sup>74</sup> and Directive 2008/105/EC<sup>75</sup> .\n- The average collection rate of WEEE in the EU was 45.9% in 202076, meaning that more than half of WEEE (around 4.7 Mt) was not properly collected and escaped the designated waste management systems. Of this amount, some was recycled under non-compliant conditions (1.12 Mt), some scavenged for valuable components (0.64 Mt), some disposed of as part of residual waste (0.6 Mt), and some legally exported (0.29 Mt)77. The remaining WEEE (2.09 Mt) is unaccounted for, including possibly illegally exported.\n- Waste treatment or recovery operations not specially equipped to treat WEEE can have adverse environmental impacts through higher emissions. Once the substances are released in the environment, for instance via air, dust, or water, they can harm the\n\n<sup>72</sup> [http://www.urbanmineplatform.eu/composition/eee/elements.](http://www.urbanmineplatform.eu/composition/eee/elements)\n\n<sup>73</sup> Study on the cumulative health and environmental benefits of chemical legislation (2017): https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b43d720c-9db0-11e7-b92d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\n\n<sup>74</sup> Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions - OJ L 334 17.12.2010, p. 17.\n\n<sup>75</sup> Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy - OJ L 348, 24.12.2008, p. 84.\n\n<sup>76</sup> Measured as the weight of WEEE collected relative to the average weight of electronic equipment put on the market in the 3 preceding years, i.e. 2017-2019.

For example, over time mercury emissions can bio-accumulate along the food chain and cause serious toxication. A reduction in the hazardous substances in WEEE treated in this way can reduce those unwanted emissions and prevent adverse impacts.\n\n▪ Exported WEEE may be processed using inadequate or unsafe WEEE recycling techniques that do not meet the same protection standards as those in the EU. In particular, there is a high risk that WEEE exported illegally from Europe will cause severe damage to the environment and to human health, for example when processed in small workshops using very basic methods such as manual disassembly and open incineration without emission-control techniques.\n\nAs for the **effects on human health**, the evaluation study came to the conclusion that both waste workers and, to a lesser extent, consumers are generally exposed through three different routes: inhalation, skin contact or ingestion<sup>78</sup> . There is a risk that improper use or accidents (e.g. breaking of mercury containing discharge lamps) can lead to health damage. [Table 1](#page-26-0) summarises the possible health damages from excessive exposure to four RoHS substances and also includes a reference to the relevant EU legislation defining exposure limits of workers.\n\n| Substance79                                               | Potential health damage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Occupational exposure limit (EU)                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cadmium and<br>its inorganic<br>compounds<br>048-001-00-5 | Harmful if inhaled – H332.<br>Harmful in contact with skin –<br>H312.<br>Harmful if swallowed – H302.                                                                                                                                                              | 8 hours limit value: 0.001 mg/m3<br>(inhalable fraction)<br>Transitional measures until 11.7.2027<br>Binding occupational exposure limit<br>value<br>(Directive 2004/37/EC on<br>carcinogens<br>or mutagens at work) |\n| Chromium(VI)<br>compounds<br>024-017-00-8                 | May cause cancer by inhalation –<br>H350i.<br>May cause an allergic skin reaction<br>– H317.                                                                                                                                                                       | 8 hours limit value: 0.005 mg/m3<br>Transitional measures until 17.1.2025<br>Binding occupational exposure limit<br>value<br>(Directive 2004/37/EC on carcinogens<br>or mutagens at work)                            |\n| Lead<br>082-001-00-6                                      | Harmful if swallowed or inhaled.<br>H302 + H332.<br>May damage fertility or the unborn<br>child – H360Df.<br>May cause harm to breast-fed<br>children – H362 (other lead entry)<br>May cause damage to organs<br>through prolonged or repeated<br>exposure – H373. | 8 hours limit value: 0.15 mg/m3<br>Binding occupational exposure limit<br>value<br>(Directive 98/24/EC on<br>risks related to<br>chemical agents at work)                                                            |\n\n<span id=\"page-26-0\"></span><span id=\"page-26-0\"></span>**Table 1: Potential health damage and occupational exposure limits of hazardous substances (Source: evaluation study)**\n\n<sup>78</sup> K.

For instance, in a 2014 study<sup>80</sup> on workers' exposure at three e-waste recycling plants in Sweden, where significantly higher levels of chromium, lead and mercury were found in recycling workers than in other workers.\n\nA higher risk for workers is anticipated when WEEE is processed outside the designated waste management systems, as the presence of hazardous substances (see [Table 1\\)](#page-26-0) is less evident and/or less stringent occupational health and safety measures are taken. In addition, EU occupational requirements do not apply to exported WEEE.\n\nIn view of this and the significant amount of exported WEEE, it is worth highlighting that, as reported in several studies81, the impact of the RoHS Directive on human health, especially on workers, is most visible outside the EU.\n\nThe stakeholders' views on the impact of workers' health are divided. Businesses and industry associations pointed out that EU workers are not significantly impacted by the RoHS-induced reduction in hazardous substances in EEE, as numerous measures to protect health and safety standards in the EU were already in place (as reported in the [Table 1](#page-26-0) above). NGOs highlighted that, regardless of measures already in place, the reduction in hazardous substances in EEE triggered by the Directive had still had a positive impact on the health of workers exposed to hazardous substances both during manufacturing but also at the end of these products' life.\n\n<sup>80</sup> A.

(N=21)**\n\n[Figure 2](#page-28-0) shows that for products produced and sold in the EU, around half of the respondents (9 of N=21) agree that the health and safety aspects of EEE have improved in the last decade.\n\nOne example concerned the positive impact on workers' health in the mercury-added lamp manufacturing sector where, as a result of the RoHS Directive, the permitted mercury content in the manufacturing of fluorescent lamps was reduced<sup>82</sup> . Workers initially used to pour liquid mercury into the lamps, with around 50% loss and spillages occurring; as a result, the workers and surrounding workspace would become contaminated with mercury and exposed workers would be affected by mercuriosis. With the maximum allowed quantity reduced, manufacturers started to use different techniques, such as strips, pellets or amalgam, where the mercury would be contained and eventually released within the lamps; as a result, no mercury spillages and high exposure would occur. However, other legislation, such as occupational health regulations, have certainly also made a significant contribution to this effect.\n\n#### *4.1.3 The RoHS Directive has contributed to the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE*\n\nIf the amount of hazardous substances in EEE has decreased over time, it can also be concluded that, **at the end of the EEE life cycle, such substances entered the waste stream in smaller quantities**. For instance, the evaluation study analysis<sup>83</sup> corroborating Eurostat data on EEE waste streams with data provided by the Urban Mine Platform database84, concluded that the amount of lead contained in WEEE generated in the EU<sup>85</sup>\n\n<sup>82</sup> Many respective exemptions were not extended in the last review and are due to expire in 2023.\n\n<sup>83</sup> Appendix III.\n\n<sup>84</sup> <http://www.urbanmineplatform.eu/composition/eee/elements>\n\n<sup>85</sup> Including the United Kingdom.\n\nhas been decreasing since 2011, from around 70 kilotons to 28 kilotons in 2020. Knowing that the number of products in WEEE streams has increased in the last few years, it is therefore reasonable to assume that the decrease in lead seen in WEEE is due to a decrease in the amount of lead in individual items of EEE.\n\nAs for the **impact of the RoHS Directive on the recovery and disposal processes applied to waste EEE**, disentangling the effects of the two complementary pieces of legislation, WEEE and RoHS Directive, on waste EEE treatment is not straightforward (e.g. the WEEE Directive identifies a set of *materials and components* of EEE that should receive selective treatment, while the RoHS Directive identifies the *substances* in EEE). Overall, however, it can be concluded that the RoHS Directive has had an impact on waste EEE treatment beyond the requirements of the WEEE Directive as it contributed to reduce the amount of hazardous substances in WEEE.\n\nThe amount of WEEE being collected and treated is increasing (see [Figure 3\\)](#page-29-0). The WEEE Directive and the RoHS Directive have contributed to this positive trend. As the RoHS Directive has driven down the amounts of hazardous substances in EEE, the concentrations in mixed WEEE have diminished too. These material streams can more easily meet product requirements (e.g. under the REACH Regulation or POP Regulation) and thus be recycled.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/3 description: The image is a bar graph that shows the total amount of waste put on the market, collected, treated, recovered, and reused/recycled from 2012 to 2020. The x-axis shows the different categories of waste management, and the y-axis shows the amount of waste in thousands of tons. The graph shows that the total amount of waste put on the market has increased from about 7,500 tons in 2012 to about 12,000 tons in 2020. The amount of waste collected, treated, recovered, and reused/recycled has also increased over this period, but not as much as the amount of waste put on the market. The note indicates that the 2019 and 2020 data are Eurostat estimates, and the source is Eurostat.\n\n<span id=\"page-29-0\"></span><span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**Figure 3: EEE put on the market and WEEE collected and treated (in thousand tonnes), EU 28**\n\nThe RoHS Directive also contributes to the objectives of the circular economy. Article 4(4) and 4(5) of the Directive contain provisions for cables and spare parts, which are excluded from the substance restrictions. Additionally, time-limited exemptions in Annexes III and IV provide another possibility for ensuring the continued availability of spare parts for older devices that depend on them. This helps to avoid premature end of life for EEE. However, the provisions, some of which are due to expire, are not clearly summarised in one comprehensible paragraph, and might need to be updated in view of the new objectives.\n\n#### *4.1.4 By introducing harmonised restrictions, the RoHS Directive has created a level playing field for all manufacturers, thus effectively contributing to the functioning of the internal market*\n\nThe evidence gathered, mostly from the established legal framework and its implementation and from the consultation responses, suggests that RoHS introduced a harmonised set of rules for establishing a level playing field for the movement of EEE across Europe. All Member States have adopted legislation which transposes RoHS into national law. Harmonised application of the Directive was further enhanced by the alignment of the Directive with the New Legislative Framework (NLF) <sup>86</sup> whereby RoHS 2 <sup>87</sup> introduced requirements regarding CE marking, conformity assessment and other obligations on economic operators. Uniform application of general provisions and harmonised implementation facilitate a consistent framework for different product regulations. This makes the rules easier to understand, increases legal certainty and supports the smooth functioning of the internal market.\n\nAlso worth mentioning here is the process of reviewing and amending the list of restricted substances in Annex II to the Directive through delegated act, for example, on the basis of a proposal from a Member State. This process provides a means of keeping up with the need for further harmonisation.\n\nFindings from the OPC confirmed the positive contribution the Directive has had on the functioning of the internal market. Similarly, in the targeted survey of Member State authorities, 55% agreed that RoHS contributed to free movement of EEE in the EU.\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/3 description: The image is a bar graph that shows the results of a survey asking if the RoHS Directive has helped to ensure the free movement of electrical and electronic equipment throughout the EU. The x-axis shows the response options, which are \"Yes\", \"To a limited extent\", \"No\", and \"Don't know/blank\". The y-axis shows the number of respondents. The graph is divided into two sections: \"Businesses & Associations\" and \"Others\". For \"Businesses & Associations\", the number of respondents for each option is approximately: \"Yes\" (37), \"To a limited extent\" (17), \"No\" (10), and \"Don't know/blank\" (22). For \"Others\", the number of respondents for each option is approximately: \"Yes\" (8), \"To a limited extent\" (2), \"No\" (1), and \"Don't know/blank\" (3).\n\n**Figure 4; Expert OPC responses: Free movement of EEE in the EU (N=101)**\n\nHowever, during the stakeholder workshop organised as part of the evaluation study, several stakeholders from Member States and from industry expressed concerns about the administrative burden linked to the transposition of the delegated directives amending the RoHS Directive. The workshop participants asked whether another form of legal instrument, i.e. a regulation, would help reduce this burden.\n\n<sup>86</sup> New legislative framework, consisting of Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and Decision 765/2008/EC, as already outlined in Section 3 of the document.\n\n<sup>87</sup> There were no such obligations at the EU level under RoHS 1 Directive.\n\nAny amendments made to the legislation through delegated directives concerning the exemptions in Annexes III and IV requires resources from the Member States to transpose the provisions into national law and to notify the Commission of the national rules. There is a risk that legal uncertainties can arise concerning content and timing (e.g. different adoption dates within the transposition period). If the Directive were converted into a regulation, any changes to the regulation would apply directly. Follow-up work in the form of transposition would be significantly reduced, both for Member State administrations and for the Commission (see also [4.1.6\\)](#page-37-0). However, this has to be weighed against the Member States' interest to integrate flexibly the remaining provisions into their existing legal systems.\n\n#### *4.1.5 Regulatory benefits counterbalance the regulatory costs*\n\nAs evidenced from the above effectiveness analysis, the RoHS Directive has produced wider environmental and health benefits, even though other initiatives contributed to the same objective. For example, it has reduced damage to the environment and human health, generated economic benefits, levelled the playing field for businesses in the internal market and created legal certainty. [Table 2](#page-31-0) below summarises the assessment of the **regulatory benefits** that stem from and can be attributed to the RoHS Directive. It has proved difficult to quantify the monetary benefits as they mainly relate to the protection of the human health and the environment.\n\n| Table 2: Assessment of the benefits of the RoHS Directive |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benefit                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Environmental benefits                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Avoided emissions of hazardous substances from WEEE       | The reduction in hazardous substances in EEE results in lower environmentally damaging emissions during WEEE recycling processes.                                                                                                                                                     | Achieved to some extent.

Following the entry into force of time-limited exemptions for the use of mercury in certain lamp categories, there have been new investments and software innovation in mercury-free LED technology<sup>88</sup> . However, certain stakeholders representing categories 8 and 9 of Annex I to the Directive<sup>89</sup> reported negative impacts on innovation as the need to allocate resources to find alternatives to RoHS substances in their products reduced the resources available to conduct research and development.\n\n<sup>88</sup> The RoHS 1 Directive entered into force in 2003.

The central concept, \"Regulatory benefits,\" is positioned at the top and connected to two main categories: \"Improved wellbeing\" and \"Market efficiency.\" Under \"Improved wellbeing,\" there are two subcategories: \"Environmental benefits\" and \"Health benefits.\" The \"Environmental benefits\" include \"Avoided emissions of hazardous substances,\" \"Decrease of hazardous substances in WEEE and improved recyclability of EEE,\" and \"Contribution to circular economy.\" The \"Health benefits\" include \"Reduction in the hazardous substances exposure for workers in production and WEEE recycling plants\" and \"Decreased negative health effects to consumers.\" Under \"Market efficiency,\" there is one subcategory: \"Economic benefits,\" which includes \"Contribution to proper functioning of internal market\" and \"Increase in innovation.\"\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span><span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>**Figure 6: Overview of the regulatory benefits of the RoHS Directive (Source: evaluation study)**\n\nThe **regulatory costs** can be broken down into three categories, information **compliance costs, engineering compliance costs, and enforcement & implementation costs**.\n\n##### Information compliance costs\n\nThe compliance costs for businesses related to the RoHS Directive include collecting and reviewing information, gathering supply chain information, costs related to dedicated IT systems to manage all required information, and costs related to the exemption system.\n\nThe Directive sets out the specific obligations of manufacturers in Article 7, of importers in Article 9, and of distributors in Article 10. When placing EEE on the market, the manufacturer must ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the substance restrictions. This includes the conformity assessment procedure, carried out here as internal production control, which includes technical documentation, quality management in manufacturing, affixing the CE marking and issuing the EU declaration of conformity. Importers and distributors must ensure that the manufacturer has fulfilled their obligations. All economic actors must make available the requisite information (e.g. the serial number of the EEE or the contact point) and must ensure that further information can be made available to competent authorities upon request.\n\nIn addition to the costs for manufacturers, there are also costs for raw material suppliers as they have to provide information to the manufacture as input to create the mandatory technical documentation. The information must be managed and provided throughout the whole supply chain, which creates costs for these companies.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance with the RoHS Directive. Companies bundle tasks related to general compliance or administration, and do not typically have one team specifically in charge of RoHS compliance but teams responsible for compliance with a long list of pieces of legislation. The staffing costs in FTEs related to the RoHS Directive depend on many factors, such as the size of the company or the EEE categories produced. For many businesses (N=11) that report having fewer than 3 FTEs, the average is 0.28 FTE per year; larger companies may have more.\n\nMost compliance costs stem from the general requirements for placing products on the market (e.g. providing technical documentation). Some costs are fixed and stay the same, even for producers of equipment that fell in scope when the Directive was extended.\n\nCompanies (in particular EEE manufacturer) that still require time-limited exemptions also face another form of compliance costs. Some businesses already use substituted hazardous substances in their products. Some do not have to apply for an exemption, as exemptions under the RoHS Directive are valid for all companies and thus the costs are carried by one company or one consortium (see more under point [4.1.6\\)](#page-37-0). The main costs are linked to preparing the application form and answering questions during the evaluation process.\n\nApplying for an exemption under the RoHS Directive is free of charge, unlike the authorisation process under REACH where fees are charged in line with the polluter-pays principle<sup>90</sup> . A fee for processing requests for exemptions was brought in in April 2023<sup>91</sup> under the UK's new RoHS legislation, which was based on the EU RoHS Directive.\n\n##### Engineering compliance costs\n\n<sup>90</sup> Article 62(7) and Title IX of REACH.\n\n<sup>91</sup> [https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/fees-for-processing-applications-for-exemptions-from](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/fees-for-processing-applications-for-exemptions-from-rohs-regulations)[rohs-regulations](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/fees-for-processing-applications-for-exemptions-from-rohs-regulations) (23-01-2023).\n\nManufacturers indicated that another major cost driver is the cost of technical compliance to comply with the hazardous substance restrictions in their product (in the product development phase). In the business focus group, participants noted this includes R&D costs and the cost of validating alternatives. Those engineering costs mainly occurred in around 2002 when the RoHS Directive came into force and restricted the use of certain substances.\n\nThere are national and European funds and programmes (e.g. InvestEU, Horizon Europe, LIFE)<sup>92</sup> that support research and innovation to achieve phasing-out hazardous substances.\n\nAnother increase in costs is expected when the scope extends from RoHS 1 to RoHS 2 and the four phthalates are included in the list of restricted substances. For many companies, the cost of investing in finding alternatives fall over time as the EEE sector develops. Once alternatives exist and are available, R&D investments are no longer needed to replace the hazardous substances. However, some companies may struggle to find reliable substitutes and others may have applications for which alternatives are not expected to be available in the near future.\n\nFor EEE that remain excluded by time-limited exemptions, companies continue to spend on R&D to seek substitutes or to redesign their products with different ambitions. The cost of applying for an exemption may be an incentive to seek opportunities to substitute hazardous substances in products rather than to collect and submit the extensive data required to make a substantiated application.\n\n##### Enforcement & implementation costs\n\nBased on the responses received from 10 Member States, the range of FTEs needed to enforce and implement per Member State is between 0.3 to 4.75 FTE per year. The total budget including staffing costs ranges from EUR 10 000 to over EUR 400 000 per year. For most Member States, the enforcement costs are higher than the implementation costs. The enforcement of the substance restrictions appears to be the largest cost heading.\n\nThe cost of transposing amendments via delegated directives into national legislation is the main cost involved in implementation. Out of the 15 responding Member States, 10 indicated that they have to transpose these changes 'manually' in the national legislation and five said that they have 'dynamic' links to Annexes III and IV to the RoHS Directive, which means they have cross-reference to the European legislation without specifying the content. According to the Member States, 'manual' transposition requires between two and 12 months, though most indicated it took considerably less than 12 months. A rough estimate of the cost of implementing four delegated directives is between EUR 9 178 and EUR 55 066 per year and per Member State. Assuming that 2/3 of all Member States (18) lack 'dynamic' links, the yearly costs involved in transposing delegated acts is estimated at between EUR 165 000 and EUR 991 000.\n\nThe main cost for the European Commission is in running the exemption system. The European Commission spends on average the equivalent of 1.0 FTE per year on in-house\n\n<sup>92</sup> [https://investeu.europa.eu/index\\\\_en](https://investeu.europa.eu/index_en) [https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-2020_en)[open-calls/horizon-2020\\\\_en](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-2020_en) https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/life\\_en\n\nstaffing and around EUR 150 000 per year on studies to amend Annexes III and IV<sup>93</sup> . Under Article 5(1)(a), it amends the Annexes by issuing specific delegated acts. Since the RoHS 2 Directive entered into force in 2011, around 80 delegated acts were adopted under the RoHS Directive (as at December 2022). Not all exemption requests resulted in a delegated directive. Some were considered unjustified for an exemption, some were merged into one act and some were withdrawn by the applicant. That means that there were more exemption requests submitted and evaluated than delegated acts adopted.\n\nThe number of exemption requests has increased over the years. One reason is that exemptions in several entries had to be more specific, which creates technical complexity and requires a higher level of detail (see also Chapter [2.2.3\\)](#page-14-0). The other reason is that different expiry dates for EEE categories related to one exemption entry increases further the number of entries.\n\nThe number of pages for exemptions has also increased over the years. In 2003, there was only one annex with one page. In 2011, two annexes were adopted and the number of pages increased to six. In 2022, the list of exemptions ran to 18 pages, with some listed exemptions having already expired.\n\nThe number of exemption requests with decisions pending has accumulated over the years. By December 2022, over 60 exemption requests were pending, most being requests to renew existing exemptions.\n\nFigure 7 gives an overview of the regulatory costs associated with the RoHS Directive.\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/5 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the different types of regulatory costs. The diagram is structured as a tree, with \"Regulatory costs\" at the top, branching into \"Direct costs\", and \"Enforcement & implementation costs\". \"Direct costs\" further branches into \"Technical costs\" and \"Compliance costs (administrative burden)\". \"Technical costs\" includes \"R&D\" and \"Substance substitution\". \"Compliance costs (administrative burden)\" includes \"Collecting and reviewing information of use of hazardous substances in the supply chain\", \"Investment in an IT system to manage supply chain information\", and \"Exemption application\". \"Enforcement & implementation costs\" includes \"Enforcement and implementation costs MSs\".\n\n**Figure 7: Overview of regulatory costs for the RoHS Directive (Source: evaluation study)**\n\n##### Conclusions\n\nAlthough the costs and benefits cannot be quantified in monetary terms, the benefits in terms of improved wellbeing or market efficiencies can be assumed to be of higher value than the compliance and implementation costs. The costs for industry in complying with the RoHS Directive are expected to be partly offset by the economic benefits. This applies especially to the costs spread over more than 20 years in which a directive has\n\n<sup>93</sup> Average costs for the years 2017-2022; the costs for external contracts fluctuate significantly over years depending on the number of requests.\n\nbeen in place. Prioritising a healthy environment and good public health plays a key role in achieving a more sustainable industry. According to the Evaluation Study, stakeholders also generally agreed that the costs of the Directive were justified. Annex IV gives an overview of the estimated costs and benefits of the Directive.\n\n<span id=\"page-37-0\"></span><span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>\n\n#### *4.1.6 The exemption process is not sufficiently transparent and efficient*\n\nThe evaluation process concluded that certain provisions on exemptions to the Directive (Article 5, Annexes III and IV) lack transparency, efficiency and internal coherence.\n\nOn the issue of internal coherence, some stakeholders stated that they have found gaps, contradictions, overlaps or missing links within the Directive. On closer examination of these statements, it appears that it is rather a question of understanding and unclear wording, which leads to different interpretations by stakeholders. Some of the issues raised do not concern the exemption process and they are tackled in point [4.1.9.](#page-42-0)\n\nMany stakeholders identified the exemption procedure as an area in need of improvement. They highlighted the need to:\n\n- improve the transparency and predictability of the exemption process;\n- reduce the length of the process to evaluate and grant exemptions;\n- increase the validity period of exemptions and the length of transition periods.\n\n### Exemption process\n\nBy running targeted surveys and interviews, the evaluation study ascertained that the Directive's main issue of transparency and predictability concerns the lack of clarity and/or guidance on the methodologies to use for the exemption procedure.\n\nThe Commission's RoHS website (section 'Implementation') <sup>94</sup> provides information about the procedure and the timeframe of the exemption process. It includes a guidance document published in 2012 and the application form to request an exemption to guide stakeholders on the process and in planning any exemption request.\n\nSince 2011, all applications for an exemption must contain the elements described in Annex V. However, the evaluation found that many applications contained only superficial or outdated information on these points (for example, life cycle assessments not in line with official standards), indicating the need to clarify and update these points.\n\nThe Commission published an exemption evaluation methodology based on Article 5(1)(a) of the RoHS Directive in November 2020<sup>95</sup> . However, to date, no official EU guidance documents have been adopted to explain the methodology to use when making Article 5(1)(a) applications.\n\nIt could not be confirmed that obliging economic operators to justify their request for an exemption in a regular term encourages the substitution of hazardous substances in EEE (see [4.1.1\\)](#page-22-0).\n\n<sup>94</sup> [https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)[directive\\\\_en](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)\n\n<sup>95</sup> Study underpinning the review of the list of restricted substances and to assess a new exemption request under RoHS 2 (Pack 15) – Chapter A.10.0 Exemption Methodology [https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-](https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=) [01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=.](https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=)\n\nThis assessment also found that some applications repeated the same arguments and time periods needed to make the substitution as used in previous applications, even many years later. This can significantly hamper substitution and undermine other efforts to substitute hazardous substances. With regular reviews, it is important not to start from the beginning and not to re-evaluate the same arguments made in previous applications.\n\nIn line with the Better Regulation guidelines, and in addition to the consultation phase in the technical exemption assessment, the Commission publishes the draft delegated acts for feedback for four weeks on the Have Your Say website<sup>96</sup> .\n\nIn addition to the need to improve the transparency of the exemption process itself, three stakeholders mentioned that it is **difficult to track changes to exempt applications and the publication of new, reformulated, and deleted exemptions**. To date, the current and consolidated version of the RoHS Directive including the annexes is available online via EurLex and on the Commission's RoHS website. The European Commission also publishes frequent updates to the list of RoHS exemptions with the validity period and the related rolling plan<sup>97</sup> . While this list does not have any legal status, it assists stakeholders in tracking exemption changes and the validity of exemptions for which a renewal has been requested. Stakeholders can also subscribe to platforms<sup>98</sup> run by the consultants assisting the Commission with exemption evaluations, which publish regular updates on new studies and consultations. These platforms are project-related and depend on the consultants commissioned.\n\n### Criteria for exemptions\n\nStakeholders felt that Article 5(1)(a), which lays down provisions on the criteria for granting, renewing or revoking exemptions, lacked clarity.\n\nOne example provided by a Member State competent authority was whether a socioeconomic assessment is a 'set' part of the methodology to be applied under Article 5(1)(a) of the RoHS Directive. On this point, one business association stated that according to the current interpretation of the RoHS Directive, it is not possible to grant an exemption based on additional factors mentioned in Article 5(1), such as the availability of substitutes and the results of a socioeconomic assessment; these elements should become set criteria under the Article 5(1) RoHS methodology. Another business association indicated the need for a clear socioeconomic assessment under Article 5(1) and suggested seeking the expertise of the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) and the Socio-Economic Analysis Committee (SEAC) under the REACH Regulation in the RoHS socio-economic assessment.\n\nOn the third criterion<sup>99</sup> in Article 5(1)(a), stakeholders indicated the need for the process and methodology for the decision on exemption applications to clearly set out how to quantify and evaluate the 'total environmental and human health benefits of an innovative new technology'. Clear guidance on how to quantify and evaluate the total\n\n<sup>96</sup> [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say\\\\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en)\n\n<sup>97</sup> European Commission, Implementation of the RoHS Directive, [https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)[directive\\\\_en.](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)\n\n<sup>98</sup> The Oeko-Institut 'RoHS evaluations' platform enables stakeholders to register for notifications on studies and consultations, see: [https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/registration.](https://rohs.exemptions.oeko.info/registration)\n\n<sup>99</sup> *The total negative environmental, health and consumer safety impacts caused by substitution are likely to outweigh the total environmental, health and consumer safety benefits thereof.*\n\nenvironmental and human health benefits would reduce the costs to industry in drafting exemption applications.\n\nThe Commission published a guidance document for RoHS exemption requests on its website100, where the criteria are further interpreted. However, it seems that for stakeholders not all questions are answered.\n\n### Duration of process\n\nSeveral stakeholders pointed out that the time required to evaluate and grant an exemption has increased from 12-18 months in 2006 to 3 years or more in 2020 (they indicated up to 40 months). The average time it takes to evaluate exemptions and run the decision process to amend the annexes is over 24 months (status December 2022).\n\nThe stakeholders who raised this point explained that, in their view, excessively long timeframes for evaluation puts significant legal and planning uncertainty on European companies, and this has an impact on their competitiveness.\n\nThe timeframe for making an exemption decision depends on several factors. One factor is that changes on exemptions must be integrated in the annexes by adopting individual delegated directives. This means that every change to an exemption requires a full decision-making process to adopt a delegated directive. These administrative requirements can multiply the workload and increase the length of the process.\n\nAnother factor is related to the resources available for the exemption process. For the Commission, resources are needed to manage and evaluate exemptions and manage the process of preparing, consulting on and adopting the delegated act. For the applicant, it is crucial to have sufficient resources to put together a quality application and communicate during the clarification and consultation phase. Especially where specialised technologies are covered by an exemption, the contributions made by other stakeholders (e.g. users of alternative technology) are essential to verify claims in the application. If sufficient resources are not available, the process can take longer as it is harder to obtain the information needed to make a balanced assessment. In fact, the trend observed in recent studies (e.g. under Pack 26101) is that fewer stakeholders are now contributing to exemption evaluations, which could be related to a high workload.\n\nAnother issue is linked to the fact that different categories and maximum exemption durations are specified for exemptions from different EEE categories. This results in different expiry dates for the same material or technical application102, which require individual applications and evaluations (increasing the administrative costs). This approach results in more entries, making the exemptions more complicated and less comprehensible for stakeholders and enforcement authorities alike. Lastly, this approach\n\n<sup>100</sup> [https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)[directive\\\\_en](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive/implementation-rohs-directive_en)\n\n<sup>101</sup> [Study to assess request for one \\(-1-\\) exemption, for lead as a thermal stabilizer in polyvinyl chloride](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/49205318-3249-11ed-975d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-269532766)  [\\(PVC\\) used as base material in amperometric, potentiometric and conductometric electrochemical](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/49205318-3249-11ed-975d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-269532766)  [sensors which are used in in-vitro diagnostic medical devices for the analysis of creatinine and blood](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/49205318-3249-11ed-975d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-269532766)  [urea nitrogen \\(BUN\\) in whole blood, in Annex IV of Directive 2011/65/EU \\(Pack 26\\)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/49205318-3249-11ed-975d-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-269532766)\n\n<sup>102</sup> For example, lead in copper alloy covered by exemption 6(c) in Annex III has three different expiry dates.\n\nties up more resources on each side, with limited effectiveness, and it can delay other decision-making processes.\n\n## Validity and transition periods\n\nUnder Article 5(2) of the RoHS Directive, exemption entries are **valid** for up to five or seven years, depending on their EEE category listed in Annex I. For example, medical devices (category 8), which often take a long time to develop, test and validate and have a longer lifetime than other EEE, may be valid for up to seven years. Applicants often request exemptions for a maximum validity period, but do not always substantiate their request.\n\nStakeholders indicated that longer validity periods should be granted for substances/products when substitutes will be available in the short-term. Although categories 8 and 9 already have longer validity periods of up to seven years, the industry is in favour of longer validity periods due to the elaborate process of product checks and validations before these products can be approved for the market.\n\nUnder Article 5(6) of the RoHS Directive, if an application for renewal is rejected or an exemption is revoked, the **transition period** must be set at between 12 and 18 months. In past technical assessments of exemption requests, some technical applications were found to no longer require an exemption, but a transition period of 12 months still had to be included in the decision. However, other technical assessments found that for technical applications that no longer meet the criteria in Article 5(1)(a), a transition period of 18 months would still have considerable socio-economic impacts as it takes longer than this to adapt complex supply chains. Also, where it is foreseeable that the exemption criteria will no longer be met at a specific date, beyond 18 months, the Commission must grant the exemption and enable stakeholders to re-apply for the exemption. The new application must be evaluated again, which takes on average 12 months. These limitations can lead to more administrative work, longer validity periods than justified and reduces the predictability of decisions on exemptions for stakeholders.\n\n#### *4.1.7 The substance restriction process is not sufficiently transparent and efficient*\n\nThe evaluation process indicated that the process to review and amend the list of restricted substances in Annex II is not sufficiently transparent or predictable for stakeholders.\n\nArticle 6, which lays down provisions for reviewing and amending the list of restricted substances, contains the procedural requirement that any amendments of Annex II should be periodically assessed, either by the Commission at its own initiative or following a proposal submitted by a Member State. The Commission must also consult interested parties, including economic operators, recyclers, treatment operators, environmental organisations and employee and consumer associations.\n\nAlthough no official guidance has been adopted, a practical guidance for the substance restriction methodology based on RoHS Article 6 was prepared for the Commission as part of a study. This guidance was published in February 2021<sup>103</sup> .\n\n<sup>103</sup> Study underpinning the review of the list of restricted substances and assessing a new exemption request under RoHS 2 (Pack 15) – Chapter A.1.0 Methodology for Identification and Assessment of Substances for Inclusion in the list of restricted substances [https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-](https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar&part=)\n\nThe last review of new substances covered by Annex II was initiated in 2015 and a technical report published in February 2021. Seven substances or substance groups were evaluated, with no delegated act yet adopted based on Article 6(3). An informal working group including private-sector stakeholders was created to facilitate information exchange between stakeholders and the Commission104. The process included four consultation rounds with stakeholders and three stakeholder meetings. As for the preparation of all delegated acts, the Member States expert group was also consulted<sup>105</sup> .\n\nSeveral industry stakeholders are of the opinion that the methodology for reviewing the list of restricted substances under Article 6 should adopt elements of the methodology for identifying and restricting substances under the REACH Regulation, such as the socioeconomic assessment. It should also take account of the expertise of the SEAC and RAC. In line with the 'one substance, one assessment' principle in the framework of the chemicals strategy for sustainability, the Commission sees potential to create synergies with existing procedures regulating hazardous substances and to improve coherence between different pieces of legislation.\n\n#### *4.1.8 Lack of clarity and adaptation provisions to reflect latest developments*\n\nStakeholders in the evaluation process often mentioned the need to clarify the terms and procedures and to issue more guidance documents. This includes updating existing guidance documents, since the current 'Frequently Asked Questions' document was produced in 2012<sup>106</sup> .\n\nExamples include the question as to whether lamps come under category 5 'lighting equipment' or under the EEE category of the final product, and questions on the scope of the Directive. Stakeholders had many questions regarding the meaning of 'large-scale applications' within the scope exclusions in Article 2(4), with some aspects explained in the FAQ document.\n\nSome stakeholders asked for clarification of radio frequency identification (RFID) applications. RFID is typically described as a small chip (or tag), which can store information digitally and be attached to a wide range of products. The Commission answered the question regarding scope, whether the RoHS requirements should apply to the RFID only or also to related article, in the current set of FAQ. Stakeholders may still require further clarification as the market for RFID tags has expanded in recent years.\n\nCurrently, Article 2(4)(i) of the RoHS Directive specifies that the Directive must not apply to photovoltaic panels (PVP) intended to be used in a system that is designed, assembled and installed by professionals for permanent use at a specified location to produce solar energy for public, commercial, industrial and residential applications. This exclusion does not apply to incorporated parts, e.g. pocket calculators, and it should help achieve the aim to increase the share of renewable energy in energy production.\n\nHowever, there are some arguments in favour of reviewing this scope exclusion. First, the installation of PVP has continued to rise strongly. Second, the vast majority of PVP\n\n|     | service/download-handler?identifier=ce50dc9c-6c19-11eb-aeb5-                  |                                                          |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|     | 01aa75ed71a1&format=pdf&language=en&productionSystem=cellar∂=.                |                                                          |\n| 104 | Expert group E03063<br>groups/details?groupId=3063.                           | https://intragate.ec.europa.eu/regexpback/screen/expert- |\n| 105 | Expert group E02810<br>groups/details?groupId=2810.                           | https://intragate.ec.europa.eu/regexpback/screen/expert- |\n| 106 | https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive_en |                                                          |\n\ntechnologies currently installed (Crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride and perovskite) are reliant on applications that require the use of lead and/or cadmium in concentrations higher than the limits set in Annex II to the RoHS Directive.\n\nThe waste management of these PVP is becoming an increasingly pressing concern. PVPs have been included in the scope of the WEEE Directive since 2012 and are subject to its requirements. This includes the provisions on separate collection, extended producer responsibility and treatment.\n\nThe challenge for this exclusion is to protect human health and the environment from hazardous substances that modern PVP contain, while not significantly restricting the installation and development of new solar cells in Europe and enabling a fast transition to a fossil fuel free energy sector.\n\n<span id=\"page-42-0\"></span><span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>\n\n#### <span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>*4.1.9 Lack of coherence (consistency) with other related pieces of legislation and policy goals*\n\nEU legislation does not function in isolation. It interacts with other areas of EU action and the RoHS Directive is no exception. The RoHS Directive makes explicit links and references to other pieces of legislation and vice versa, and the practical effects of the Directive influence the functioning or effectiveness of other legislation, and vice versa.\n\n86% of respondents (N=74) under the OPC indicated that there was an issue of 'external coherence', i.e. coherence (consistency) between the RoHS and related legislation. 8 out of 15 respondent Member States also indicated an issue of external coherence. The regulatory mapping and subsequent consultation activities carried out as part of the evaluation study found that at least 15 EU legislative measures are directly related to the RoHS Directive<sup>107</sup> .\n\nThe main issue of the RoHS Directive's external coherence was found to be the overlap between the substance restrictions laid down in the RoHS and the substance restrictions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 ('REACH Regulation'), by Directive 2009/125/EC ('Ecodesign Directive') and Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 ('POPs Regulation').\n\nThe above-mentioned pieces of legislation contain mechanisms to restrict the presence of certain substances that could also affect EEE. The mechanisms can differ, which complicates the issue, and can create confusion for stakeholders. The Commission is coordinating these different mechanisms and their outcome to improve external coherence between those pieces of legislation. For example, the Commission published a common understanding paper in 2014 on managing regulatory action on the same chemical substances under REACH and the RoHS Directive<sup>108</sup> .\n\nThe maximum concentrations of substances to be tolerated in EEE have not been changed since they were introduced in the RoHS Directive. However, technical and scientific progress has resulted in changes in the concentration limits for some of these substances in other chemicals legislation such as REACH or POPs.\n\nFor example, Annex I to the POPs Regulation restricts, among others, the placing on the market of articles containing more than 500 mg/kg PBDE. However, EEE under the\n\n<sup>107</sup> See Appendix IV to the evaluation study available a[t https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2779/89335.](https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2779/89335)\n\n<sup>108</sup> European Commission, REACH and Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS) a common understanding Ref. Ares(2014)2334574 14/07/2014.\n\nscope of the RoHS Directive is excluded from this restriction. The RoHS Directive allows up to 1000 mg/kg PBDE in homogenous material in EEE. However, PBDE is no longer intentionally added to EEE material above 500 mg/kg, which is suggested by the fact that no RoHS exemption covers new EEE applications. The main use of PBDE as a flame retardant requires considerably more than 1000 mg/kg.\n\nIt could be argued that PBDE in EEE coming from recycled WEEE streams and residual concentrations between 500-1000 mg/kg may still be relevant for EEE. However, under the POP Regulation it was shown that maximum concentration levels of PBDE in waste can be lowered to 500 mg/kg and, under certain conditions, even lower in future<sup>109</sup> . That means there might be no longer a need for the concentration range between the POP concentration level of 500 mg/kg and the RoHS concentration level of 1000 mg/kg.\n\nReducing the concentration limits set in Annex II to the RoHS Directive would be in line with the EU chemicals strategy for sustainability towards a toxic-free environment. Doing so would also increase coherence between both pieces of legislation.\n\nThere are other aspects of inconsistency between legislation too. For example, the POPs Regulation restricts the substance hexabromobiphenyl without any maximum concentration level. This substance is part of the group of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), which is restricted by the RoHS Directive, which sets a maximum limit of 1000 mg/kg in homogenous material.\n\nOn the links between RoHS and REACH, REACH established mechanisms that restrict the use and placing on the market of specified substances in articles, including EEE. The most relevant mechanisms to this end are 'restrictions' (Title VIII, Annex XVII) and 'authorisations' (Title VII, Annex XIV). Some entries under Annex XVII of REACH contain exemptions for articles in the scope of the RoHS Directive, such as the entries for lead<sup>110</sup> , OctaBDE<sup>111</sup> and DecaBDE<sup>112</sup> and the listed phthalates<sup>113</sup> . Currently, RoHS and REACH both contain provisions regulating the use of substances listed in [Table 3.](#page-43-0)\n\n| Substance           | REACH                                                                                          |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Lead                | Entry 63 under Annex XVII<br>Entries 10, 11 and 12 under Annex XIV (Lead compounds)            |\n| Mercury             | Entries 18 and 18a under Annex XVII                                                            |\n| Cadmium             | Entry 23 under Annex XVII                                                                      |\n| Hexavalent chromium | Entry 47 under Annex XVII<br>Entries 16-22 and 28-31 under Annex XIV (Chromium-(VI) compounds) |\n| PBB                 | Entry 8 under Annex XVII                                                                       |\n| PBDE                | Entry 67 under Annex XVII (DecaBDE)114<br>Entry 45 under Annex XVII (OctaBDE)                  |\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span><span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>**Table 3: Overview of substances covered both by REACH and RoHS (Source: evaluation study)**\n\n<sup>109</sup> OJ L 317, 9.12.2022, p. 24-31 - Regulation (EU) 2022/2400 amending Annexes IV and V to POPs [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2400.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2400)\n\n<sup>110</sup> Annex XVII REACH, entry 63, par. 8, sub k.\n\n<sup>111</sup> Annex XVII of REACH entry 45 paragraph 3.\n\n<sup>112</sup> Annex XVII REACH, entry 67, par 4 sub d.\n\n<sup>113</sup> Annex XVII REACH, entry 51, par 4 sub h.\n\n<sup>114</sup> This entry is expected to be removed after the listing of DecaBDE under Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 (POPs Regulation).\n\n| Substance                                  | REACH                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| DEHP                                       | Entry 4 under Annex XIV and Entry 51 under Annex XVII |\n| BBP                                        | Entry 5 under Annex XIV and Entry 51 under Annex XVII |\n| DBP                                        | Entry 6 under Annex XIV and Entry 51 under Annex XVII |\n| DIBP                                       | Entry 7 under Annex XIV and Entry 51 under Annex XVII |\n| Substances listed in Appendix 12 to REACH: | Entry 72 under Annex XVII                             |\n| Cadmium and its compounds                  |                                                       |\n| Chromium-(VI) compounds                    |                                                       |\n| Lead and its compounds                     |                                                       |\n\nTherefore, the main issue raised by stakeholders regarding coherence between the RoHS Directive and the REACH Regulation concerns the perception that these two pieces of legislation amount to double regulation of substances in EEE<sup>115</sup> . A considerable number of stakeholders (n=66/N=101), mainly businesses but also some Member States, indicated that restricting the same substances under both the RoHS and REACH directives creates legal uncertainty. Stakeholders indicated that restrictions of a substance under RoHS and REACH may differ in terms of:\n\n- maximum concentration values;\n- scope of the legislation;\n- exemptions and their expiry dates;\n- differences in spare parts;\n- product information requirements; and\n- documentation requirements.\n\nIndustry stakeholders provided the following specific examples of perceived incoherence under the OPC of the evaluation:\n\n- Entry 72 of Annex XVII references Appendix 12, which includes concentration levels in restrictions of cadmium, hexavalent chromium and lead that are lower than the levels set under the RoHS. Certain textile items such as fabric straps for electronic fitness monitors, watches and similar devices are covered by both REACH and RoHS. Some stakeholders stated that this creates an unintentional overlap and contradiction in the requirements. However, it is unclear how the different maximum concentration values correspond to each other and to what extent this affects other stakeholders.\n- Entry 51 'phthalates' of Annex XVII states that EEE is excluded from the scope of RoHS but spare parts, components and supplied parts might not be EEE and thus they are restricted under REACH to a maximum concentration of 0.1% by weight of the plasticised material in the article. However, spare parts are not covered by the RoHS restrictions and excluded under Article 4(4) and 4(5). The relevance of this problem is unclear though.\n\nStakeholders indicated that these differences may give rise to legal uncertainty. This may also result in problems in enforcing the provisions. However, it seems that these\n\n<sup>115</sup> An 'article' is defined under REACH as an object which during production is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function to a greater degree than does its chemical composition. This definition also covers EEE.\n\ninconsistencies only apply to some stakeholders, and that to resolve the issue it would be sufficient to issue a clarification.\n\nAs for the potential overlap between the RoHS and the Ecodesign Directive, close to 40% of OPC respondents (n=86/N=101) indicated that there are unnecessary overlaps, gaps and contradictions between the RoHS and the Ecodesign Directive. 4 of the 15 respondent Member States<sup>116</sup> made the same observation.\n\nDespite the relatively high percentage of stakeholders mentioning coherence issues, only a few provided specific examples. A reason for the high share of questions on coherence might be the increasing electrification of many devices (e.g. internet of things).\n\nIn addition, a number of stakeholders under the OPC highlighted the connection and need for future coherence between the RoHS and the EU's circular economy policy, in particular with the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP) and the chemicals strategy for sustainability. The RoHS has considerable links to EU policy on the circular economy, as it facilitates sound and safe WEEE treatment and recycling and reduces the scope to keep circulating hazardous substances in products. Exemptions under the RoHS Directive enable the use of certain spare parts and the reuse of certain recovered spare parts containing restricted substances to facilitate the repair of EEE.\n\nIn relation to coherence to other related initiatives, terms such as 'closed-loop return systems' used in the Directive should be aligned with other CEAP initiatives. Another example would be suggestion to flag the presence of hazardous substances in EEE due to an exemption in a future digital product passport.\n\n## 4.2 How did the RoHS Directive make a difference?\n\n### Overall response:\n\n*The RoHS Directive yields benefits for environmental protection, human health and for the internal market. While similar levels of environmental and health protection could well have been achieved at national level, the full added value of the RoHS Directive is in facilitating the internal market.*\n\n*Harmonising rules to ease the free exchange of goods across the EU were cited as a reason for proposing legislation on this subject in 2000, since several Member States had adopted or developed legislation on hazardous substances in electronics. The same level of harmonisation could not have been achieved without the RoHS Directive. The Directive also provides clear EU added value in its influence on third countries, , which would not have happened without harmonisation at EU level.*\n\nThis section evaluates the EU added value of the Directive by exploring whether the objectives could have 'been better achieved at EU level' than could be reasonably expected by taking action at national level. The key points to assess are whether the Directive produced results beyond what would have been achieved by Member States acting alone and the Directive's added value for individuals and businesses in the EU.\n\n<sup>116</sup> Norway also indicated unnecessary overlaps, gaps and contradictions exist between the RoHS and the Ecodesign Directive.\n\n### The key aspect where the RoHS Directive has made a difference, compared to similar action taken at Member State level, is in facilitating the internal market.\n\nIn particular, since it entered into force, the RoHS Directive has improved the consistency of national conditions and resolved the fragmentation in the regulation of hazardous substance restrictions regarding EEE in the EU. National legislation on EEE and WEEE was in place or in preparation when the RoHS Directive was implemented in the early 2000s. Legislation governing WEEE was either planned or already in place in more than half of the EU's 15 Member States and for six out of 15 Member States for hazardous substances in EEE, including lead and cadmium<sup>117</sup> .\n\nIn the absence of a harmonised regulation at EU level, this legislation would have most likely remained in place and potentially even more countries could have passed similar legislation. One can assume that national-level legislation would have contributed to the protection of human health and the environment by setting national standards. However, the examples cited above neither covered the same products or substances as the RoHS Directive, nor did they set equal standards. Therefore, national legislation would have led to varying levels of protection. Given the constraints in resources in other EU Member States, it is reasonable to assume that some countries would not have adopted or enforced RoHS-like legislation fully. This in turn could have had negative effects on protection levels. Setting EU-wide standards as the RoHS Directive does solves this issue.\n\nThe inconsistency of national legislation in terms of scope (both products and substances) and limits highlights that the added value of the RoHS Directive is more clear cut in facilitating the internal market. With regards to the internal market, the proposal for RoHS legislation noted that '*diverging requirements on the phasing-out of specific substances could have implications on trade in electrical and electronic equipment*.' <sup>118</sup> As the distribution of EEE does not happen in one state, it can be assumed that, without harmonised provisions, companies would face immensely higher costs to comply with all national laws.\n\nThe EU RoHS Directive contributed to the functioning of the internal market as it sets **harmonised substance restrictions standards across countries.** It was **assessed as overwhelmingly positive in providing EU added value,** in particular:\n\n- the RoHS Directive creates a large market for the same EEE;\n- the RoHS Directive simplifies the trade of EEE in the EU;\n- the RoHS Directive supports innovation and the use of hazardous substance-free products.\n\n#### *4.2.1 The RoHS Directive has a global impact*\n\nThe RoHS Directive influenced considerably the development of regulatory frameworks regarding hazardous substances in EEE in third countries. Several stakeholders and business associations consulted for the study have confirmed that this is still valid.\n\nAccording to literature and statements by business associations, the 2002 adoption of RoHS has '*led to a global change in the design of electronic products, as multinational* \n\n<sup>117</sup> Austria, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\n<sup>118</sup> Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, COM/2000/347/Final.\n\n*companies who sell into the EU's market often opted to use the EU's stringent standards across their global production to save production costs'* 119 *.* The first harmonised standard under RoHS became the basis for the international standard. With the current European harmonised standard EN IEC 63000:2018 governing technical documentation, the new standard removed some specific wording used in the previous EU RoHS Directive.\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/1 description: This image is a world map showing the status of RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) legislation in different countries. Countries with RoHS-like legislation in place are colored green, countries that are part of the EU RoHS are colored blue, and countries with RoHS-like legislation under discussion are colored yellow. The map shows that the EU, China, and some states in the US have RoHS-like legislation in place. Brazil, Argentina, and Saudi Arabia have RoHS-like legislation under discussion.\n\n<span id=\"page-47-0\"></span><span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>**Figure 8: RoHS Directive and RoHS-like legislation in the world (Source: evaluation study)** 120\n\nA considerable number of non-EU countries<sup>121</sup> have adopted legislation that is highly similar to RoHS. These are shown in green in [Figure 8.](#page-47-0) The number of third countries with RoHS-like legislation is likely to increase in the near future, as draft legislation is being discussed in more jurisdictions, including the Gulf Cooperation Council member countries<sup>122</sup> , Brazil and Argentina. These countries are highlighted in yellow in the map.\n\nAlthough the RoHS Directive does not restrict the export of EEE, it is assumed that exports of WEEE placed on the European market, or new EEE with a reduced volume of hazardous substances due to the substance restrictions under RoHS has a major impact. In 2019, the EU Member States exported 119 279 tonnes of WEEE containing hazardous substances and 14 557 tonnes of non-hazardous WEEE. Since secondary (treated) material streams such as non-ferrous metals make up almost 1.9 m tonnes of exports 123 , and illegally exported waste is not included in these figures, the impact goes beyond the WEEE material stream.\n\n## 4.3 Is the RoHS Directive still relevant?\n\n**Overall response:**\n\n<sup>119</sup> *The Brussels effect: how the European Union rules the world,* Anu Bradford, 2020.\n\n<sup>120</sup> Illustration based on *The Brussels Effect*, Anu Bradford, 2020.\n\n<sup>121</sup> According to DigitalEurope and JBCE, RoHS was taken up in about 40 jurisdictions outside the EU, [https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DIGITALEUROPE-initial-views-on-the-revision](https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DIGITALEUROPE-initial-views-on-the-revision-of-the-EU-RoHS-Directive.pdf)[of-the-EU-RoHS-Directive.pdf.](https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DIGITALEUROPE-initial-views-on-the-revision-of-the-EU-RoHS-Directive.pdf)\n\n<sup>122</sup> Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.\n\n<sup>123</sup> Eurostat – data code ENV\\_WASTRDMP – 2020 / export / non-ferrous metal / EU 27.\n\n*The EU objectives in the context of the RoHS Directive are still relevant and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. These include the protection of human health and the environment from hazardous substances in waste EEE.*\n\n*The objectives of the RoHS Directive correspond to a large extent to the current and future needs of the EU and the relevance of the Directive remains high. Some aspects could be identified that can have a negative impact on the Directive's future relevance, in particular the slow adaptation of restrictions and exemptions and the limited degree of flexibility to respond to new needs.*\n\nThis section covers the RoHS Directive's suitability to respond to changes and challenges in the EEE sector regarding the current hazardous substance restrictions and possible future restrictions, and to current and foreseeable challenges linked to the treatment of WEEE. The **initial needs that led to the formulation of the Directive remain valid** and **the Directive still corresponds to these needs to a high extent.**\n\n### *4.3.1 Identification of needs*\n\nThe two key needs linked to the Directive's objectives as outlined in Article 1 are to reduce and prevent the content of harmful substances in EEE to achieve the protection of human health and protection of the environment. Directly linked to these two needs – and to some extent necessary to fulfil them – are the requisites:\n\n- for a sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE;\n- to take into account technological and scientific progress; and\n- to ensure a well-functioning internal market.\n\n**The need for a sound recovery and disposal of waste -EEE** is covered in detail in the WEEE Directive (see [2.2](#page-11-0) or [4.1.3.](#page-28-0)). However, harmful substances require certain treatment activities to avoid exposure for workers and to avoid releasing emissions into the environment. Reducing the volume of harmful substances facilitates the sound recovery and disposal of WEEE to achieve a high recovery rate.\n\nNew developments in product design and changes in manufacturing processes lead to constant developments in the materials and substances used. It is therefore essential that the RoHS Directive is equipped with a process that **takes account of technological progress** and responds to it accordingly. On the one hand, this may involve new evidence that certain substances should be classified as hazardous, and the need to drive technological progress towards substituting these substances. On the other hand, in the exemption process, technological developments should also be assessed from the point of view of whether use of the substance offers considerable benefits that justify an exemption. New developments in trade via e-commerce are also having an impact, in particular on implementation and market surveillance.\n\nAll these factors are put into the context of the increasing use of EEE in people's daily lives. The volume of electrical and electronic equipment put on the market in the EU rose from 7.6 million tonnes in 2012 to a peak of 12.4 million tonnes in 2020 (see [Figure 3\\)](#page-29-0) 124 . Though the RoHS Directive has banned many substances and contributed to the phaseout of those substances in EEE, it can be assumed that electrical appliances still contain\n\n<sup>124</sup> Eurostat (env\\_waseleeos) and Eurostat (env\\_waselee).\n\nhazardous substances that would need to be tackled to protect human health and the environment. This includes looking at the stages of collection, recovery and disposal at end -of -life of these appliances.\n\n#### *4.3.2 Correspondence between the Directive's original objectives and the current and future environment, health and internal market needs*\n\nProtecting human health and the environment and safeguarding the functioning of the internal market are principles enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union and they remain as valid as ever. Collecting stakeholders' views on the correspondence between the Directive's original objectives, how well they reflected and, more importantly, whether they still reflect, current and future environmental, technical, economic, and social conditions and needs, was one of the targets of the OPC. In summary, the consultation results on the **need** for EU legislation are as follows:\n\n- **protect human health**: 73% (strongly) agree; 27% (strongly) disagree (N=101);\n- **protect the environment**: 75% (strongly) agree; 25% (strongly) disagree (N=101).\n\nThese results are in line with the results from the Member State consultation, which found the majority were in strong agreement with these needs.\n\nThe OPC results for the **internal market** were slightly more nuanced. 65% of respondents agreed and 35% disagreed (N=101). However, the majority of OPC respondents and all Member States (except one) affirmed the need for EU legislation on hazardous substances in EEE to ensure a well-functioning EU internal market.\n\n### *4.3.3 Aspects that may impact the RoHS Directive's relevance*\n\nThe majority of private-sector stakeholders (n=57/N=101) did not see the need to change the **list of restricted substances** in Annex II to the RoHS Directive. Several respondents saw the need to either list new substances, de-list existing substances or change the concentration values of the substances that are currently restricted. The feedback obtained from the Member State consultation showed that a large majority of respondents considered it necessary to update of the list of substances.\n\nNew substances on the market or new identified hazards of substances (e.g. endocrine disruption or persistence) can pose risks to human health and the environment. A regular and efficient update of the list of restricted substances to tackle such risks would ensure that the Directive remains relevant.\n\nGiven the increase in mechanical waste treatment as part of a **circular economy**, workers can be exposed to increasing levels of chemicals originating from WEEE. Depending on the lifetime of the EEE, the product may have been placed on the market before the restrictions came into force (13 years for large household appliances (2005) or 30 years for photovoltaic panels), which can increase the risk for workers. The timeline for restrictions coming into effect lags behind the potential risks, with the risk that the information about the presence of hazardous substances in WEEE gets lost as time passes.\n\nAnother timeframe-related challenge is that higher ambition for recycling can interfere with contaminated waste streams, where hazardous substances are not restricted at that time, for example due to a lack of efficiency of the process. However, horizontal chemical legislation such as REACH can cover restrictions for EEE.\n\nAs a result of the decision taken under the Basel Convention to make all WEEE transboundary movements subject to the prior informed consent procedure, it is possible that more WEEE might be remain in and be treated within the EU in future.\n\nStakeholders view the **exemption process** as indispensable to meet the specifics of certain products, industries and manufacturing processes. However, deficiencies in the exemption process, in particular issues of efficiency (see [4.1.6\\)](#page-37-0), can have a negative influence on the relevance of the Directive. The process must strike the right balance between stringency and well-founded criteria for an exemption, the effort required to apply for an exemption and the effort required to carry out an adequate and thorough, but not too lengthy, evaluation of the application.\n\nSo far, the objective is to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in EEE. In the past, narrowing the scope of exemptions could lead to significant savings of hazardous substances. Today there are exemption requests for low volumes of hazardous substances, for example the application for exemption 37 in Annex IV indicated less than 1 gram of lead. Other exemption requests only apply to a few manufacturers, such as exemption 41 in Annex IV requested by one manufacturer for a single specific system. Given the efficiency and the future challenges in handling more individual exemption requests, it is questionable whether the standard procedure for time-limited exemptions for such exemptions are adequate and whether the effort involved justifies the process.\n\nBy contrast, some exemptions cover many tonnes of hazardous substances, such as exemption 7(a) in Annex III for lead in high melting temperature solders covers between 150 and 9 400 tonnes of lead per year. For other exemptions, there is evidence of alternatives, but the socio-economic distortion for the market would be unacceptable for society. In these cases, an in-depth investigation could help make thorough decisions.\n\nThere are other incentives used, other than regulatory measures, to reduce the volume of hazardous substances in EEE (see also the second support study). For example, there are requirements stemming from eco fee modulation under extended producer responsibility (e.g. in France), a chemicals tax for certain chemicals in EEE (e.g. in Sweden) or voluntary agreements or requirements in the supply chain adopted by more ambitious companies to phase out hazardous substances (e.g. IBM or Hewlett-Packard).\n\n# 5 CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED\n\nThe RoHS Directive has helped to reduce hazardous substances in EEE in the EU. Collecting quantitative and reliable data on the reduction of hazardous substances in EEE is challenging. A quantitative estimate made in the evaluation study shows that there is a total reduction of hazardous substances in EEE between 2003 and 2016, even though shortcomings in the analysis method and assumptions lead to a less robust quantitative result. The substance restrictions of the RoHS Directive alone did not lead to this reduction.\n\nThe reduction of hazardous substances in EEE has thus increased the protection of human health and the environment at different stages of the value chain (especially in production and disposal). However, providing quantitative and reliable data to prove the positive impacts between the reduction of hazardous substances and the human health / the environment is difficult.\n\nThe Directive has also contributed to the harmonisation and functioning of the internal market by providing uniform rules for the restriction of hazardous substances for producers of EEE in the EU. These were taken over by the relevant industry sector. However, inspections by enforcement authorities suggest that some product categories have high levels of non-compliance, which can mitigate the positive effects. In addition, exchanging compliance information along the supply chain poses problems in practice.\n\nThe evaluation process also concluded that the Directive remains relevant. The need to protect human health and the environment and to contribute to the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste EEE by restricting of the use of hazardous substances in EEE remains relevant and will continue to be in the near future. The Directive's EU added value is also prominent, and the evidence collected during the evaluation process suggests that the same level of harmonisation could not have been achieved in the absence of the RoHS.\n\nNevertheless, there are aspects that work less well. Regarding innovation, the RoHS Directive prompted investments in finding substitutes for hazardous substances that in many cases led to the development of alternatives. However, industry perceives the investments associated with the inclusion of medical equipment and monitoring and control instruments in the Directive's scope as considerable due to their area of application and the comparatively long-life cycles of these product categories. In general, it was difficult to quantify the costs for stakeholders as it is not possible to disentangle the costs of compliance with the RoHS Directive and separate them from the costs of compliance with other legislation.\n\nThe evaluation process identified a need to clarify and improve the methodologies for assessing exemptions and for reviewing and amending the list of restricted substances to give stakeholders more certainty on the grounds for restricting new substances and for adopting exemptions. In addition, the methodologies should be updated to reflect technological developments and be more coherent (consistent) with other procedures under legislation governing chemicals. Increasing the robustness and efficiency of the process would help maintain stakeholder confidence in the process and ensure a high level of cooperation between all parties involved. The frequent amendments of the Annexes pose an administrative burden for authorities and stakeholders, who questioned whether a directive was the most efficient legal form.\n\nThe process also flagged the need to clarify some definitions. It may be necessary to revise the Directive's provisions on scope exclusions to ensure that the selection of EEE excluded from the Directive's scope is sufficiently clear and updated in line with the latest technical and economic developments.\n\nRegarding external coherence, the process identified overlaps between the substance restrictions laid out in the RoHS Directive and similar provisions laid down by the Ecodesign Directive or the REACH and POPs Regulation. For example, overlaps or incoherencies in the scope, definitions, limit values or mechanisms to deviate from the restrictions may give rise to a fragmented regulatory landscape and, in some cases, to a lack of clarity and certainty for Member State authorities and industry. However, many perceived coherence issues can find an answer in legislative and non-legislative documents, even if these are not formulated in a sufficiently comprehensible and transparent manner and the concerns expressed often relate only to individual areas without their broader impact being substantiated. Finally, the RoHS Directive had remarkable influence beyond European Union borders, with similar laws adopted in approximately other 40 jurisdictions around the world. The Directive is considered to be a global benchmark for reducing toxic substances in EEE, with potentially significant environmental and health benefits worldwide.\n\n## 5.1 Lessons learned\n\nOverall, the RoHS Directive functions well. The restrictions have been implemented and have contributed to a reduction in the volume in hazardous substances in EEE. However, most conclusions were made on qualitative assessments. There is a need to introduce indicators, which are reproducible and can measure progress and success of the RoHS Directive.\n\nSome aspects in the Directive need to be updated to improve coherence and to reflect technical developments on the market. There is a need to inform stakeholders and to provide guidance, in particular on the scope of the Directive or the exemption procedure.\n\nThe evaluation highlighted that the processes for deciding on exemptions and updating substance restrictions under the RoHS Directive are to some extent lacking transparency and efficiency and can be improved in terms of scientific robustness. In addition, revising the Directive in the future can be an opportunity to simplify, to streamline with other legislations and to align with other policy objectives.\n\n# 6 ANNEX I: PROCEDURAL INFORMATION\n\n## *Lead DGs and internal references*\n\nThe evaluation (PLAN/2018/3000) has been coordinated by the European Commission's Directorate-General (DG) for Environment, supported by an interservice steering group (ISG) involving representatives of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, DG Energy, DG Justice and Consumers, DG Research and Innovation, the Joint Research Centre, DG Taxation and Customs Union, DG Trade, DG Health and Food Safety, the Legal Service and the Secretariat-General. The group steered and monitored the evaluation's progress and ensured that it met the necessary standards for quality, impartiality and usefulness.\n\n## *Organisation and timing*\n\nThe Commission published a roadmap<sup>125</sup> for the evaluation of the RoHS Directive on 14 September 2018; feedback on this roadmap was received until 12 October 2018.\n\nThe consultation strategy was published jointly with the publication of the RoHS Directive's evaluation roadmap, mentioned above. The strategy set out a number of consultation activities, comprising a public consultation and targeted consultation in the form of interviews and surveys. While a detailed consultation synopsis is provided in Annex V, a brief explanation of consultation activities follows here.\n\nTo maximise stakeholder engagement, the evaluation followed the targeted consultation approach. In this context, the OPC was launched on 13 September 2019 and remained open for 12 weeks until 6 December 2019 to obtain input on the questions examined in the report. In total, 163 responses were collected. In parallel to the OPC, an in-depth survey (questionnaire) was shared with Member State authorities involved in implementing the RoHS Directive.\n\nBetween October 2019 and March 2020, three focus groups were organised, covering the following topics: (i) assessment of the Directive's implementation and enforcement; (ii) effectiveness and efficiency – environmental and health aspects; (iii) effectiveness and efficiency – costs and benefits aspects; and (iv) external and internal coherence. In the same period, in-depth interviews were organised with stakeholders, partly as follow-up interviews to input provided via the OPC.\n\nA workshop was held towards the end of the study, in March 2020, to present the preliminary findings of the study and provide stakeholders with another opportunity to provide their input.\n\nTo supplement input from the stakeholder consultation, a stakeholder workshop was organised in March 2020 (online, due to the COVID-19 restrictions). The workshop was attended by 125 stakeholders from public authorities, industry representatives (economic operators and their representatives at EU and national level) and other stakeholders, including NGOs and academic experts.\n\n<sup>125</sup> [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Hazardous-substances-in](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Hazardous-substances-in-electrical-%20%20electronic-equipment-evaluation-of-restrictions_en)electrical- [electronic-equipment-evaluation-of-restrictions\\\\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Hazardous-substances-in-electrical-%20%20electronic-equipment-evaluation-of-restrictions_en)\n\n## *Exceptions to the Better Regulation guidelines*\n\nNo exceptions were made to the Better Regulation guidelines<sup>126</sup> during this evaluation.\n\n## *Evidence, sources and quality*\n\nThe evaluation was supported by a study that among other things provided support on stakeholder consultation. This study was launched in March 2019 and performed by a consortium led by Ecorys<sup>127</sup>. The study was completed in March 2021<sup>128</sup> .\n\nThe following key studies and reports were taken into account:\n\n- legal acts and documents related to the Directive's implementation129;\n- studies and report related to exemption and restriction assessment 130 .\n\n# 7 ANNEX II. METHODOLOGY AND ANALYTICAL METHODS USED\n\nThis annex provides a brief and transparent account of the methods and sources employed during the RoHS Directive evaluation, including the limitations (e.g. data) encountered.\n\n**Central to the methodology used during the evaluation process were the evaluation questions** (and sub-questions) developed on the basis of the five evaluation criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value. To gather information and data to enable a thorough analysis of the Directive's operation and progress, the following **main sources** were used by the Ecorys-led consortium who provided the support study:\n\n- literature review\n- desk and databases research\n- stakeholder consultation, including interviews and targeted surveys\n- focus groups\n- reports by market surveillance authorities\n- legal, policy and technical sources\n\n## The analytical approach to evaluate the Directive included:\n\n- analysis of consultation findings\n- triangulation of stakeholders' views\n- qualification and quantification of costs and benefits estimates\n- etc.\n\n<sup>126</sup> [https://ec.europa.eu/info/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox\\\\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox_en)\n\n<sup>127</sup> Study 'Support for the evaluation of Directive 2011/65/EC on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS)' commissioned by DG Environment under the Implementing Framework contract No ENV.F.l/FRA/2014/0063.\n\n<sup>128</sup>[https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/926420bc-8284-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1/language](https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/926420bc-8284-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF)[en/format-PDF.](https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/926420bc-8284-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF)\n\n<sup>129</sup> https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive\\_en#ecl-inpage-617.\n\n<sup>130</sup> *See* consultant final reports published at https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohsdirective\\_en#ecl-inpage-621.\n\n**Unfortunately, data collection proved to be a significant challenge** which impacted the quality of the analysis and robustness of findings. For instance:\n\n- Data is lacking on the concentration of hazardous substances in EEE waste per category of product, and there was insufficient data available on the weight of the 'homogeneous materials' in the EEE for which the maximum concentration values are regulated.\n- Availability of data is limited both for the period before and around implementation of the RoHS Directive, as well as for more recent years. It was not possible to collect precise information from the literature review or through interviews. Some interviewed stakeholders and participants in the focus groups indicated this could be due to the lack of a reliable monitoring framework in place before the first RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) and the fact that a relevant amount of RoHS-compliant equipment placed on the market might have not yet reached end of life. Therefore, estimations had to be made.\n- As regards the data on costs and benefits:\n  - Companies were not able to provide a precise estimate of the percentage of turnover spent on RoHS compliance both in terms of their initial investment cost and operating expenditure. Therefore the data was not sufficient to put together an overall assessment of the costs, but sufficient to put together an estimate of the costs.\n  - Companies found it easier to provide FTE estimates, the highest estimates having been provided by businesses representing EEE categories 3, 8 and 9<sup>131</sup> .\n  - The quantification of benefits was to a large extent not possible due to the lack of precise data on the reduced amount of all hazardous substances as a consequence of the RoHS Directive.\n\n# Robustness of analysis and conclusions\n\nThe input provided by stakeholders during the consultation process remained limited for some important data The data limitations outlined above put a substantial strain on the analysis. To address possible information and data gaps, after completion of the OPC, a stakeholder workshop was organised to present the initial findings and test them against a broad range of stakeholders. Triangulation of sources played a critical role in ensuring that the findings were robust. Where primary data was not available, the evaluation relied on literature and expert opinions. As a result, and on the basis of the additional input received, the evaluation was accordingly refined and, where necessary, revised. The report needs to be read with these caveats in mind – while the report cannot provide a precise assessment, the findings reflect the order of magnitude of the impacts.\n\n<sup>131</sup> Annex I of the RoHS Directive lays down the 11 categories of EEE covered by this Directive, as follows: 1. Large household appliances; 2. Small household appliances; 3. IT and telecommunications equipment; 4. Consumer equipment; 5. Lighting equipment; 6. Electrical and electronic tools; 7.Toys, leisure and sports equipment; 8. Medical devices; 9. Monitoring and control instruments including industrial monitoring and control instruments; 10. Automatic dispensers; 11. Other EEE not covered by any of the categories above.\n\n# 8 ANNEX III. EVALUATION MATRIX AND DETAILS ON ANSWERS TO THE EVALUATION QUESTIONS (BY CRITERION)\n\nThis annex presents the evaluation matrix which served as the organising framework of the evaluation work and answers to the questions by evaluation criterion. All the evaluation criteria – effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value – are addressed in the matrix. The analysis and evidence collected via the matrix provided the main points substantiating the assessment in Section 4 – Evaluation findings.\n\n| Evaluation (sub) question

restrictions exemption system has been found to be complex and inefficient in a couple of ways. Firstly, the administrative burden associated with the exemption system is seen to be significant, although there is not enough available evidence from the literature and stakeholder consultation to quantify this cost. Secondly, the process of handling exemption requests is said to be slow. These factors lead to costs for the manufacturers. A number of key areas for improvement of the exemption system have been identified by stakeholders. These areas have varying implications for compliance costs for businesses, implementation costs for the European Commission and costs to society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Evaluation SWD – Section 4.1<br>Evaluation study, p. 89–92.                                                           | Targeted survey<br>Key stakeholder interviews/focus groups<br>Interviews<br>Public consultation                                             |  |\n| Question 7: Is the form of the legal instrument (directive) the best fit to efficiently achieve the set objectives?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description of other possible types of legal instruments that could have achieved the same result<br>Description of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Identification of other types of instruments and their relative efficiency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | There is not a clear conclusion on whether another form of legal instrument would be a better fit to achieve the objectives under the Directive.

Some aspects could be identified that can have a negative impact on the Directive's future relevance.

the OPC and targeted consultations and interviews, businesses indicated that it is easier to estimate the number of FTEs needed to comply with the RoHS Directive than the direct yearly operational cost and initial investment cost. Some 95 businesses and business associations provided an answer on the number of FTEs involved. Their response can be broken down as follows: 22 responded 'none'; 36 responded 'other'; 37 provided FTE estimates and 12 of those were business associations. Table 1 below shows the breakdown **by type of economic actor and by businesses and business association.**\n\n| Table 1: Breakdown of companies who submitted FTE estimates (n = 95) |                      |                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                                      | Number of businesses | Number of business associations |\n| Raw material supplier                                                | 1                    | 6                               |\n| Distributor /importer                                                | 3                    | 0                               |\n| Manufacturer of components                                           | 5                    |                                 |\n| Manufacturer of finished components                                  | 24                   | 22                              |\n| Other                                                                | 6                    | 11                              |\n| Unknown                                                              | 10                   | 2                               |\n\n**Table 1: Breakdown of companies who submitted FTE estimates (n = 95)**\n\nMore precisely, Table 1 shows:\n\nTotal 49 46\n\n- 13 respondents indicated a range of 1-3 FTEs working on RoHS compliance and 12 respondents indicated a range of more than 3 FTEs.\n- 9 of the respondents indicated that a range of more than 3 FTEs are manufacturers of components or finished EEE.\n- 9 respondents indicated that they do not have FTEs working on compliance with RoHS.\n- 13 respondents indicated 'other'. Those respondents either indicated that it was hard to estimate the number of FTEs or that the number of FTEs was significantly higher than 3. These respondents were primarily among respondents on behalf of business dealing with EEE falling under RoHS categories 3, 8, 9, and 11.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 below, based on data collected as part of the OPC, show the number of FTEs working on compliance to RoHS, by type of company and by organisational size.\n\n# Figure 1: Number of FTEs working on compliance with RoHS, by type of company (n=49)\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/0 description: The image is a bar chart that shows the number of businesses by type and number of employees.

The x-axis shows the size of the business, which is divided into four categories: Micro (1 to 9 employees), Small (10 to 49 employees), Medium (50 to 249 employees), and Large (250 or more). The y-axis shows the number of businesses. The chart shows that the majority of businesses are large, and that most of these businesses have more than 3 FTEs. There are also a significant number of businesses that have less than 1 FTE, less than 2 FTEs, and less than 3 FTEs. The number of businesses that have other or unknown FTEs is relatively small. The number of micro businesses with less than 1 FTE is 1. The number of micro businesses with none is 1. The number of small businesses with less than 1 FTE is 1. The number of medium businesses with less than 1 FTE is 2. The number of medium businesses with less than 2 FTEs is 1. The number of medium businesses with unknown FTEs is 1. The number of large businesses with less than 1 FTE is 2. The number of large businesses with less than 2 FTEs is 3. The number of large businesses with less than 3 FTEs is 9. The number of large businesses with more than 3 FTEs is 9. The number of large businesses with other FTEs is 2.

STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION – SYNOPSIS REPORT\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Commission collected opinions of citizens, stakeholders, competent authorities, and third countries. A wide range of consultation activities was employed to reach out to this diverse group. This report provides an overview of the consultation strategy and the individual activities. In addition, it reports on the number of people and organisations engaged and provides some of the main outcomes.\n\n## 2. The consultation strategy\n\nThe consultation strategy was published jointly with the publication of the RoHS Directive's evaluation roadmap<sup>132</sup> . To further elaborate the consultation strategy, the research team mapped the stakeholders, identifying all relevant groups and suitable consultation tools to reach out to them. The aims of the consultation were to collect information, data, evidence and opinions and to complement the desk research. The stakeholder consultation activities consisted of:\n\n- a feedback period on the RoHS Directive's evaluation roadmap, which ran from 14 September 2018 to 12 October 2018;\n- an OPC, which ran from 13 September 2019 to 6 December 2019;\n- an in-depth survey (questionnaire) shared with Member State authorities involved in implementing the RoHS Directive, in parallel to the OPC;\n- three focus groups, organised between October 2019 and March 2020;\n- in-depth interviews, organised partly as follow-up interviews to input stakeholders provided via the OPC;\n- a workshop organised towards the end of the study in March 2020 to present the study's preliminary findings and provide stakeholders with another opportunity to provide their input.\n\nMany stakeholders shared their experiences with implementing the Directive and provided additional supporting evidence. Information was collected on all five evaluation criteria covered by the evaluation: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value.\n\nThe following sections provide information on all consultation activities. Each section provides an overview of the nature and number of respondents. The sections also summarise the main outcomes of each of the consultation activities.\n\n## 3. Online public consultation\n\n### *3.1 Participants*\n\nThe OPC remained open for 12 weeks, in line with the requirements of the Better Regulation guidelines. The questionnaire for the OPC was uploaded to the EU Survey\n\n<sup>132</sup> [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Restriction-of-hazardous](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Restriction-of-hazardous-substances-evaluation)[substances-evaluation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1891-Restriction-of-hazardous-substances-evaluation)\n\nwebsite and translated by the translation service of the European Commission into 24 languages.\n\nThe OPC was open to anyone interested. The questionnaire was structured into three sections. The introductory section collected some background information on the respondents. The second section contained questions tailored to respondents who selfidentified as non-experts, while the third section targeted experts, i.e. stakeholders with specific knowledge on hazardous substances in EEE. The questions in each section reflected the level of expected knowledge of the respondents and were thus more detailed for experts than for non-experts. Every respondent filled in two out of the three sections of the questionnaire, with the introductory section being filled in by everyone. Depending on their profile (non-expert or expert), respondents also filled in either the second or third section of the questionnaire. In total, 163 responses were collected, of which 125 responses (77%) were directly submitted via the EU Survey website. In addition, a representative of the UK's Enterprise Europe Network submitted additional 38 responses (23%) to the general part of the survey from companies via an uploaded file as part of an answer to the OPC. One completely empty response was removed from the sample.\n\nThe majority of replies came from respondents in the UK (51 responses) and Belgium (32 responses), followed by Germany (25) and Japan (16 responses) (Table 1). Almost half of the replies, 77 responses, were from respondents outside the EU (Japan, United Kingdom, Switzerland, others)<sup>133</sup> .\n\n| Country | Responses | %   | Country        | Responses | %    |\n|---------|-----------|-----|----------------|-----------|------|\n| Belgium | 32        | 20% | Lithuania      | 1         | 1%   |\n| Denmark | 1         | 1%  | Netherlands    | 2         | 1%   |\n| Finland | 2         | 1%  | Portugal       | 2         | 1%   |\n| France  | 6         | 4%  | Spain          | 2         | 1%   |\n| Germany | 25        | 15% | Sweden         | 4         | 2%   |\n| Ireland | 2         | 1%  | Switzerland    | 1         | 1%   |\n| Israel  | 1         | 1%  | United Kingdom | 13 (+38)  | 31%  |\n| Italy   | 7         | 4%  | United States  | 8         | 5%   |\n| Japan   | 16        | 10% | Total          | 163       | 100% |\n\n**Table 4 Overview of country of origin of respondents to the OPC**\n\nNote: as mentioned above, we considered 162 responses for the analysis.\n\nAbout four out of five respondents indicated that they have specific knowledge in the policy field and/or on the RoHS Directive. Therefore, a clear majority (63%) of respondents filled in the longer and more detailed version of the public consultation, while 61 respondents (37%) filled in the shorter and more general version. Companies and business associations submitted more than 70% of all responses (see Table 2 below). As\n\n<sup>133</sup> At the time the OPC was open, the UK was still a Member State.\n\nmentioned above, a significant share of these (16 replies) was from Japanese companies; this could be an indication of the importance of the RoHS Directive for international trade.\n\n| Stakeholder type              | Responses | %   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----|\n| Business association/ Company | 128       | 79% |\n| Academic/research institution | 1         | 1%  |\n| EU citizen                    | 22        | 13% |\n| Non-EU citizen                | 2         | 1%  |\n| NGO                           | 2         | 1%  |\n| Other                         | 3         | 2%  |\n| Public authority              | 5         | 3%  |\n\n| Table 5 | Distribution of responses by stakeholder group |  |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------|--|\n|         |                                                |  |\n\nBecause of the sample size, self-selection and unequal geographical distribution, the responses to these questions should not be considered representative of a wider sample or of citizens of the EU overall.\n\n#### *3.2 Outcome of the questionnaire for the non-experts*\n\nQuestions for non-experts mostly focused on respondents' perceptions. They explored the perceived safety of products for consumers, and explored whether respondents were willing to accept potential trade-offs between the safety of EEE for the environment and health on the one side, and the cost of EEE on the other side. The questions further explored the recycling habits of respondents as well as the perceived added value of EU interventions in this policy field.\n\n**Figure 1 Number of responses by category: Has the legislation helped to reduce the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment?**\n\nImage /page/78/Figure/7 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the responses of citizens and businesses to a question. For citizens, approximately 21% responded \"Yes\", 7% responded \"No\", and 3% responded \"Don't know/blank\". For businesses, approximately 21% responded \"Yes\", a negligible amount responded \"No\", and 47% responded \"Don't know/blank\".\n\nFor this section of the questionnaire, which targets non-experts, out of the 62 replies collected, one business association provided one completely empty response. As such, the research team considered 61 replies for this sample instead of 62. 42 responses (69%) were from businesses, 18 (30%) from individuals and 1(1%) from an NGO (considered in the category 'citizens' in Figure 2). The majority of the respondents recognised that the RoHS Directive helped to protect human health and to reduce damage to the environment, either fully or to a limited extent. Although 42% of respondents agreed that the legislation has helped to reduce the use of hazardous substances in EEE, 69% of the businesses indicated that this impact of the legislation was unknown.\n\nMost of the businesses (93%, in total 39) and citizens (95%, in total 18) agreed on the necessity of restrictions on hazardous substances in EEE to protect the environment.\n\n##### *3.3 Outcome of the questionnaire for experts*\n\nA total of 101 respondents filled in the part of the OPC questionnaire for experts and not the non-experts' questions. Businesses and their associations submitted 86 responses (85%), with the remaining 15 (15%) coming from academia, NGOs, public authorities and individual experts. Therefore, the results of this part of the public consultation are very much driven by perceptions of industry representatives.\n\nSimilar to the respondents to the general part of the public consultation, a substantial majority of respondents to the specific parts agreed that the Directive has helped reduce the use of hazardous substances in EEE and thus helped protect the environment.\n\nInformation from respondents suggests that implementing the RoHS Directive has resulted in additional costs for businesses. A majority of respondents indicated that they had incurred one-off costs and increased operational costs due to implementing the Directive.\n\n**Figure 2 Number of responses by category: Have you made any initial investment to comply with RoHS?**\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/7 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the responses of \"Businesses & Associations\" and \"Others\" to a question with three possible answers: \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and \"Don't know/blank.\" For \"Businesses & Associations,\" approximately 53% answered \"Yes,\" 10% answered \"No,\" and 20% answered \"Don't know/blank.\" For \"Others,\" approximately 5% answered \"Yes,\" 5% answered \"No,\" and 6% answered \"Don't know/blank.\"\n\n**Figure 3: Number of responses by category: Has your operational costs / the operational costs for the companies you represent increased due to compliance with RoHS?**\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/9 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the responses of \"Businesses & Associations\" and \"Others\" to a question with three possible answers: \"Yes\", \"No\", and \"Don't know/blank\". For \"Businesses & Associations\", approximately 70% answered \"Yes\", around 5% answered \"No\", and about 12% answered \"Don't know/blank\". For \"Others\", approximately 5% answered \"Yes\", around 1% answered \"No\", and about 8% answered \"Don't know/blank\".\n\nA majority of stakeholders stated that legislation such as the RoHS Directive is still needed to protect the environment, with 75% of respondents to the expert questionnaire agreeing with this statement. More than one in two respondents also indicated that the Directive simplifies trade within the EU. In line with this, three out of four respondents would expect negative consequences if the RoHS Directive were to be withdrawn.\n\n### Figure 4 Number of responses by category: There is still a need for EU legislation on hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment to protect the environment?\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/2 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the responses of \"Businesses & Associations\" and \"Others\" to a survey. The x-axis represents the level of agreement (Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know/blank), and the y-axis represents the percentage of respondents, ranging from 0% to 35%. For \"Businesses & Associations\", the percentages are approximately: Strongly agree (20%), Agree (31%), Disagree (15%), Strongly disagree (6%), Don't know/blank (14%). For \"Others\", the percentages are approximately: Strongly agree (8%), Agree (3%), Disagree (2%), Strongly disagree (1%), Don't know/blank (2%).\n\n#### *3.4 Additional input and position papers*\n\nIn addition to a set of closed questions, respondents were invited to provide additional details and information in open questions. The two questionnaires allowed space for respondents to share any additional information as desired and provided the opportunity to upload a position paper.\n\nIn total, 40 (25%) respondents (out of 163 respondents) provided additional information<sup>134</sup> . 17 (10%) respondents pointed out several overlaps between the RoHS Directive and other EU legislation such as the Ecodesign Directive, the REACH Regulation, the Energyrelated Products (ErP) Directive, the Waste Framework Directive and the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Regulation. In their responses, several participants to the public consultation focused on the exemption system. For example, they considered the duration of the exemption process to be too lengthy and asked for longer exemption periods in cases where research is exhaustive and no substitutes available. Two stakeholders also pointed out the needs and limitations of specific sectors, including medical equipment and entertainment lighting.\n\n## 4. Questionnaire to Member States\n\n### *4.1 Participants*\n\nA targeted questionnaire was developed for Member State competent authorities in charge of implementing the RoHS Directive. Special attention was paid to information likely to be held exclusively or predominantly by Member State authorities. In addition, the Member States were also asked about the state of implementation of the Directive in their respective jurisdictions. The questionnaire was launched in the second half of September 2019 and a\n\n<sup>134</sup> This includes a number of comments concerning the questionnaire, as well as responses such as 'None', and responses pointing to position papers.\n\nreminder was sent by the Commission to respondents at the end of October 2019. A reminder was also sent to respondents who had entered their email contact in the system but not yet responded.\n\nA total of 20 responses were received. 13 (65%) respondents fully completed the questionnaire, whereas six (30%) responded partially. Responses cover 15 Member States as well as Norway.\n\nImage /page/81/Figure/2 description: This image is a map of Europe, with different countries shaded in different colors to indicate whether a questionnaire was completed or partially completed. Countries shaded in dark blue indicate that the questionnaire was completed, while countries shaded in light blue indicate that the questionnaire was partially completed.

The legend at the bottom of the image indicates that dark blue represents \"Questionnaire completed\" and light blue represents \"Questionnaire partially completed\".\n\nImage /page/81/Figure/3 description: Figure 5 provides an overview of Member States that responded to the questionnaire.\n\n#### *4.2 Outcome*\n\nMember State representatives responding to the targeted survey overall assessed the Directive positively in terms of achieving its objectives. A clear majority of respondents stated that the safety of EEE for humans and the environment had improved in the last 10 years, and that RoHS led to reduced use of harmful substances in EEE.\n\n**Figure 6 Responses to the question: Has the RoHS Directive helped to reduce the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment in the EU?**\n\nImage /page/81/Figure/7 description: The image is a bar chart showing the number of responses for four categories: Yes, No, I don't know, and No answer. The y-axis represents the number of responses, ranging from 0% to 100%. The x-axis represents the four categories. The bar for \"Yes\" reaches 80%, the bar for \"I don't know\" reaches approximately 15%, and the bar for \"No answer\" reaches approximately 5%.\n\nMember State representatives responding to the survey indicated that withdrawing the RoHS Directive would have negative consequences for achieving the Directive's four objectives. Eleven respondents believed that withdrawing the Directive would have negative consequences for the protection of human health and for the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of WEEE. Thirteen Member States believed a withdrawal would have negative consequences for the protection of the environment, and 9 respondents expected that it would have negative consequences in terms of ensuring a well-functioning internal market.\n\n**Figure 7 Responses to the question: What consequences do you think the withdrawal of the RoHS Directive would have for achieving the objectives of the Directive? - Ensuring a well-functioning internal market**\n\nImage /page/82/Figure/2 description: This image is a bar chart showing the number of responses to a survey. The x-axis shows the different response options: Positive consequences, Negative consequences, Don't know, and No answer. The y-axis shows the number of responses, ranging from 0% to 100%. The bar chart shows that approximately 10% of respondents chose Positive consequences, 45% chose Negative consequences, 25% chose Don't know, and 20% chose No answer.\n\nAll Member State representatives *agreed* (5 respondents, 25%) or *strongly agreed* (10 respondents, 50%) that the restriction of hazardous substances in EEE continued to require action at EU level.\n\n## 5. Focus groups\n\n### *1 Participants*\n\nThree focus groups were organised in the context of this study, with a view to gathering views from representatives of Member State competent authorities, the business association, and NGOs. The participants in the focus group expressed interest in the activity and were therefore invited. The topics covered were:\n\n- assessment of the Directive's implementation and enforcement\n- effectiveness and efficiency environmental and health aspects\n- effectiveness and efficiency– costs and benefits aspects\n- external and internal coherence\n\n### *2 Outcome*\n\nAssessment of the Directive's implementation and enforcement\n\nThe first focus group with relevant Member States authorities from 8 countries (10 participants) was held on 22 October 2019 in Brussels. The emphasis of the first focus group was on the implementation and enforcement processes currently in place across the countries, as well as on the Directive's effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the baseline methodology developed by the project team to assess the likely impact of the Directive was presented and discussed. Member State competent authorities attending the focus group considered that there was a lack of clarity regarding market surveillance and asked for further guidance from the Commission.\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency – environmental and health aspects\n\nThe second focus group with NGOs took place on 12 December 2019. Three organisations attended, bringing together 3 participants and 3 members of the research team. The participants discussed whether the RoHS Directive is effective and efficient in achieving its environmental- and health-related objectives. Overall, they agreed that the Directive is delivering on its objectives, although they still see room to improve. They discussed how the RoHS is implemented and if there are aspects that hinder its effectiveness and efficiency. For example, they noted that granting too many exemptions can undermine the Directive's effectiveness.\n\nStakeholders from the NGO focus group stated that one of the Directive's main benefits is that many companies changed and started understanding the need for efficient management of chemicals.\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency – costs and benefits aspects / External and internal coherence\n\nThe third focus group, this time involving 10 representatives of business associations, was organised on 4 March 2020. In addition to gathering information and evidence on the effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the RoHS Directive from the point of view of business associations, the focus group intended to collect examples for the Directive's potential impacts and effects on business operators. More specifically, the focus group explored various effects of the Directive, e.g. its benefits, impact on innovation and the circular economy, the impact and shortcomings of the exemption system, as well as the costs incurred by businesses to comply with the Directive.\n\nThe first part of the meeting focused on effectiveness and, more especially, on the impact of the RoHS Directive on innovation, competitiveness and internal market. The group also considered the potential situation without the RoHS Directive. On this latter issue, the stakeholder agreed that leaving the matter of the RoHS Directive to the Member States would not have been better. The second part of the focus group focused on efficiency more specifically, the RoHS Directive's costs and benefits. This provided the opportunity to validate and discuss the estimated investments costs identified by the team. The third and last part of the meeting focused on the Directive's internal and external coherence. During the last session, stakeholders' inputs indicated that there are several overlaps between the RoHS Directive and other EU legislation.\n\n## 6. Targeted interviews\n\n### *1 Participants*\n\nThe interviews were conducted between July 2019 and February 2020 with relevant stakeholders from EU Member States and from other relevant countries, including Japan. Scoping interviews were performed at an early stage and then more structured interviews were used to complement information from desk research and other consultation activities.\n\nOverall, 15 interviews were performed: 11 with businesses, 3 with authorities from Member States and 1 with a consultancy / research institute. The research team tailored the interview questionnaires for each interviewee, thus making it possible to focus on the most relevant topics for each interview. Common points of discussions included the Directive's cost and benefits, its impact on innovation, and its consistency with other EU legislation. The research team interviewed experts that:\n\n- contacted the research team;\n- were suggested by DG ENV;\n\n- replied to the OPC and for which a follow-up interview was deemed useful.\n\nThe interviews with Member State authorities were also used as an opportunity to follow up on information already provided via the specific questionnaire. In one case, the agency interviewed was different from the one that responded to the questionnaire.\n\n### *2 Outcome*\n\nAll the interviewees agreed that the RoHS Directive should stay in place and that the situation would not have been better without it. The Directive allows for effective enforcement on a level playing field, mainly due to the CE marking. However, across Europe there are different enforcement cultures and thus scenarios.\n\nOverall, the interviewees agreed that the compliance cost increased from RoHS 1 to RoHS 2. This was because the latter directive came with requirements for CE labelling and further technical documentation.\n\nAs in the OPC, the interviewees pointed out the overlaps and coherence issues with other EU legislation, especially REACH, the POPs Regulation, and the Ecodesign Directive. The interviewees agreed on the international dimension of RoHS and the opportunities and challenges arising from the fact that a growing number of countries are implementing RoHS-like legislation. For instance, it is difficult for non-EU states to understand the RoHS Directive; hence, there is not full harmonisation across the globe.\n\nThe interviews with Member State competent authorities focused on issues related to the Directive's implementation and enforcement (e.g. inspections and controls, sanctions, etc.), exploring how the Directive has affected the authorities. The authorities cited problems in enforcement activities regarding exemptions, and stressed that technical documentation is complex and hard to follow for someone who is not a technician, which causes difficulties in enforcement.\n\nFurthermore, the business associations stressed several issues with the exemption system; e.g. it is too lengthy and generates significant administrative burdens. Also, R&D is somehow limited under the Directive, as money is spent on compliance and exemption processes.\n\n## 7. Workshop\n\nThe workshop was held in March 2020. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it was organised as an online webinar. The research team invited all the organisations that:\n\n- contacted the research team during the study;\n- were recommended by the European Commission for consultation;\n- participated in the consultation activities;\n- were identified during the mapping of stakeholders.\n\nAround 125 individuals (including the research team and the European Commission) joined the webinar. It brought together representatives from 12 Member States (among which 3 national institutions replied to the questionnaire), the European Commission, and 53 representatives from NGOs and industry. The organisations interviewed, and those that took part in the focus groups also participated in the workshop. Ahead of the workshop 25 organisations sent a contribution.\n\nThe workshop covered the five criteria set out in the EU Better Regulation guidelines, i.e. effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value. It provided the participants with the opportunity to comment on the study's preliminary findings for each criterion, which they received prior to the webinar. The stakeholders devoted considerable attention to the Directive's impact on innovation, the costs and administrative burden related to the different categories of EEE covered under RoHS and the Directive's consistency with the circular economy initiative.\n\nOverall, participants agreed with the study's preliminary findings. However, it was highlighted that further qualitative and quantitative data from the stakeholders could be used, and that the definition of innovation could contribute to assessing the Directive's impact on this matter more precisely.\n\nThe workshop also represented a last call for data and evidence; participants were given the possibility to provide final feedback (in written form) both during and after the workshop – 15 organisations sent a contribution."

It is now one of the fastest growing waste streams. It includes a large range of devices such as mobile phones, computers, televisions, fridges, household appliances, lamps but also medical devices and photovoltaic panels.\n\nE-waste contains a complex mixture of materials, some of which are hazardous. These can cause major environmental and health problems if the discarded devices are not managed properly. Modern electronics also contain rare and expensive resources, including critical raw materials. These can be recycled and re-used if the waste is effectively managed.\n\nImproving the collection, treatment and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment at the end of their life can increase resource efficiency and support the shift to a circular economy. It can also contribute to the security of supply for critical raw materials, ultimately enhancing the EU’s strategic autonomy.\n\n## Objectives\n\nEU rules address environmental and other issues caused by the growing number of discarded electronics in the EU. The aim is to contribute to sustainable production and consumption by\n\n- preventing the creation of WEEE as a priority\n- contributing to the efficient use of resources and the retrieval of secondary raw materials through re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery\n- improving the environmental performance of everyone involved in the life cycle of EEE\n\n## In the EU\n\n14.4 million tonnes\n\nof electrical & electronic equipment is put on the market\n\n5 million tonnes\n\nof e-waste is collected\n\n11.2 kg\n\ne-waste is collected per person\n\nThe latest figures are from 2022 and can be found on [Eurostat.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics_-_electrical_and_electronic_equipment)\n\n## Law\n\nThe [WEEE Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02012L0019-20180704) and the [RoHS Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011L0065-20160715) tackle the issue of the growing amount of WEEE.\n\nThe WEEE Directive\n\n- Requires the separate collection and proper treatment of WEEE and sets targets for their collection, recovery and recycling\n- Helps European countries fight illegal waste exports more effectively by making it harder for exporters to disguise illegal shipments of WEEE\n- Reduces the administrative burden by calling for the harmonisation of national EEE registers and of the reporting format\n- [WEEE Directive (consolidated version)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02012L0019-20180704)\n- [WEEE Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0019)\n\nFind out more about the [RoHS Directive](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/rohs-directive_en).\n\nSecondary law\n\n## Implementation\n\nInformation about the implementation of the WEEE Directive, including data and reporting and WEEE calculation tools.\n\nImplementation of the WEEE Directive\n\n[More information](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee/implementation-weee-directive_en)\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe Commission has been evaluating the WEEE Directive. This evaluation assessed whether the Directive remains fit for purpose, explored possibilities for simplification, and determined whether a review is necessary. To gather evidence from the public and a wide range of stakeholders, the Commission held an online public consultation, assisted by a study to support this evaluation.\n\nYou can find the evaluation [here](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/staff-working-document-evaluation-directive-201219eu-waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en), alongside an [executive summary of the evaluation](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/staff-working-document-executive-summary-evaluation-directive-201219eu-european-parliament-and_en), and the study’s [final report](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/final-report-study-supporting-evaluation-directive-201219eu-waste-electrical-and-electronic_en).\n\n## Timeline\n\nKey dates related to the WEEE Directive\n\n01.

    "markdown": "REACH Regulation  - European Commission\n\n [Skip to main content](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/chemicals/reach-regulation_en#main-content)\n\n![](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)An official website of the European UnionAn official EU website\nHow do you know?\n\n\n\n10 September 2025\n\nSTATE OF THE UNION\n\n[Discover more](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/state-union/state-union-2025_en?banner)\n\n# REACH Regulation\n\nTo protect human health and the environment against the harmful effects of chemical substances.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) is the main EU law to protect human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals. This is done by better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances and by taking measures, such as phasing out or restricting substances of very high concern. REACH also aims to enhance innovation and the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry.\n\nREACH places responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances. To that end, manufacturers and importers are required to gather information on the properties of their chemical substances and to register that information in a central database in the [European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)](https://echa.europa.eu/). The Agency is the central point in the REACH system: it manages the databases necessary to operate the system, coordinates the in-depth evaluation of the information provided on chemicals and runs a public database where consumers and professionals can find hazard information.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe REACH Regulation aims to:\n\n- ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment against harmful substances\n- assess the safety of chemical substances in use in the EU\n- promote innovation and competitiveness\n- promote alternative (non-animal) methods for the assessment of the hazards of substances\n\n## Law\n\nThe [REACH Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02006R1907-20221217) ( [EC 1907/2006)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32006R1907) entered into force in 2007 and has since evolved to reflect the advancement of knowledge regarding various chemicals and their properties.\n\nThe Commission is currently revising the REACH Regulation, in line with the Commission’s [Better Regulation provisions](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law/better-regulation-why-and-how_en).\n\nIt will include a thorough assessment of possible impacts of potential changes to REACH on\n\n- the protection of human health and the environment\n- the use of animal testing\n- the functioning of the internal market\n- and the competitiveness and innovation of European industry and businesses\n\nThe impact assessment and the revision proposal will be informed by existing reviews and studies, as well as several new studies that will assess policy options and impacts. Comprehensive consultations with stakeholders as part of the various studies, to ensure that all views and relevant information is taken into account. Those consultations include\n\n- an [open public consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12959-Chemicals-legislation-revision-of-REACH-Regulation-to-help-achieve-a-toxic-free-environment_en)\n- targeted stakeholder consultations of selected groups of stakeholders, as part of individual studies\n- expert and policy workshops\n- consultation of the expert group Competent Authorities for REACH and CLP (CARACAL) at regular meetings, including in sub-group meetings, where stakeholder representatives are also present. Relevant documents can be found on CIRCABC via the [expert group website](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=2385).\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Reporting\n\nNational competent authorities from EU Member States and EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) are required to submit to the Commission every five years a report on the operation of REACH and the compliance with CLP.\n\nSee the reports for [2020](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/8ee3c69a-bccb-4f22-89ca-277e35de7c63/library/a4abce8c-8425-455f-b7e6-0ead917bde6b/details?download=true) and [2015.](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/8ee3c69a-bccb-4f22-89ca-277e35de7c63/library/d363085c-9119-4b29-9734-e25c6647a5f5/details?download=true)\n\n### Registration\n\nREACH stipulates that chemical substances that exceed 1 tonne per year per company must be registered with ECHA. In this process, companies must identify the risks linked to the substances they handle and indicate how they manage them. This obligation applies to both substances and mixtures.\n\n[Key information for companies, especially SMEs](https://echa.europa.eu/support/small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes)\n\n[ECHA's registration webpages](https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/regulations/reach/registration) for more information on REACH registration\n\n### Evaluation\n\nECHA and the Member States then evaluate the information submitted by companies to ascertain whether a given substance poses risks to human health or the environment. Find out more about [the evaluation process](https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/regulations/reach/evaluation).\n\n### Authorisation\n\nThe authorisation process aims to ensure that substances of very high concern (SVHCs) are progressively replaced by less dangerous substances or technologies where technically and economically feasible alternatives are available. Find out more about [the authorisation process](https://echa.europa.eu/authorisation-process).\n\n### Restrictions\n\nREACH includes a restriction process for certain substances of very high concern if they pose an unacceptable risk to health or the environment. Such substances may be limited or even banned, if necessary. Find out more about [the restriction process](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/restriction).\n\n## Protecting consumers\n\nUnder REACH, consumers have the right to know whether the products they buy contain harmful chemicals. These substances are found in everyday products, and they have been linked to serious and often irreversible effects on health or the environment.\n\nTo assist consumers, REACH introduced the \"consumer right to know\" in Article 33. The [LIFE askREACH](https://www.askreach.eu/) project helps consumers and companies apply this right.\n\nUpon receiving a consumer inquiry about the presence of a substance of very high concern in an article, companies are obliged to reply within 45 days.\n\n## Nanomaterials\n\nNanomaterials are chemical substances or materials comprising very small particles of different shapes and sizes no larger than 100 nm. Many occur in nature, but most have been engineered to exhibit novel characteristics such as increased strength, chemical reactivity or conductivity compared to their non-nano counterparts.\n\nThe REACH Regulation initially made no specific provision for nanomaterials. In 2018 the Commission adopted [Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1881](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.308.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:308:TOC) to modify REACH technical Annexes I, III and VI-XII, introducing nano-specific clarifications and provisions. In 2020 the Commission also updated Annex II with [Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/878](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/878/oj), introducing new provisions on Safety Data Sheets to complement the new registration requirements for nanomaterials.\n\nIn 2011 the Commission adopted the [Recommendation on the definition of a nanomaterial](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reco/2011/696/oj). This definition has informed many EU directives and regulations, and has been supported by implementation guidance. The Recommendation was [reviewed and revised in 2022](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022H0614(01)) retaining its principal features. Supplemental information about the revised Recommendation has been provided by the [Industrial Minerals Association (IMA](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/8ee3c69a-bccb-4f22-89ca-277e35de7c63/library/d0ea024f-5780-4cb8-8371-3b052b849a58/details?download=true)) and the [Germany Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/8ee3c69a-bccb-4f22-89ca-277e35de7c63/library/0c26ddb4-07cc-4c40-85f4-af293260aa84/details?download=true)).\n\n## Related links\n\n**Main law:** [REACH Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02006R1907-20221217)\n\n**Related topics:** [Chemicals](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/chemicals_en),\n\n**Related strategies:** [Chemicals Strategy](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/chemicals-strategy_en), [Zero pollution action plan](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en), [Circular economy action plan](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en), [Industrial strategy](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en)\n\n**Related Commission priorities:** [European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions about EU environmental policy, please contact [Europe Direct.](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu_en)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2025-07/GettyImages-1249372405.jpg?h=119335f7&itok=eLflLnE3)\n\n- News article\n- 8 July 2025\n\n[Plastic waste: Commission consults on new rules for chemically-recycled content in plastic bottles](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-consults-new-rules-chemically-recycled-content-plastic-bottles-2025-07-08_en)\n\n- 3 min read\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2024-09/GettyImages-518247414.jpg?h=1c953990&itok=ES3yn73n)\n\n- News article\n- 13 June 2025\n\n[EU institutions agree to streamline assessments of chemicals in Europe](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-institutions-agree-streamline-chemical-assessments-europe-2025-06-13_en)\n\n- 1 min read\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2023-10/NA1512_shutterstock_1237020829.jpg?itok=G8XQntbW)\n\n- News announcement\n- 13 May 2025\n\n[EU welcomes outcomes of Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions COPs](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-welcomes-outcomes-basel-rotterdam-and-stockholm-conventions-cops-2025-05-13_en)\n\n- 1 min read\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2024-12/GettyImages-1680302937.jpg?h=be392151&itok=Sc9LOJMg)\n\n- News article\n- 19 December 2024\n\n[Commission adopts ban of Bisphenol A in food contact materials](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety-news-0/commission-adopts-ban-bisphenol-food-contact-materials-2024-12-19_en)\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2024-12/GettyImages-1195504200.jpg?h=179d94f5&itok=1_D9GGer)\n\n- News article\n- 10 December 2024\n\n[Revised Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals enters into force](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/revised-chemical-labelling-regulation-enters-force-2024-12-10_en)\n\n- 3 min read\n\n![](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/oe_theme_ratio_3_2_medium/public/2024-09/GettyImages-518247414.jpg?h=1c953990&itok=ES3yn73n)\n\n- Press release\n- 19 September 2024\n\n[Commission restricts use of sub-group of PFAS chemicals to protect human health and environment](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4763)\n\n[See all](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news_en?f%5B0%5D=oe_news_subject%3Ahttp%3A//data.europa.eu/uxp/3099&f%5B1%5D=oe_news_subject%3Ahttp%3A//data.europa.eu/uxp/c_e5d85c14)\n\n## Related Events\n\n- Training and workshops\n\n[3rd workshop on Roadmap towards phasing out animal testing for chemical safety assessments](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/events/3rd-workshop-roadmap-towards-phasing-out-animal-testing-chemical-safety-assessments-2025-06-16_en)\n\n- Monday 16 June 2025, 08:30 -

INTRODUCTION: POLITICAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT**\n\n# **1.1 Political context**\n\n<span id=\"page-3-1\"></span><span id=\"page-3-1\"></span>Chemicals are everywhere in our daily lives and play a fundamental role in most of our activities, as they form part of virtually every device we use to ensure our well-being (be it for food, electronics, toys, clothes or industrial machines), protect our health and security, and meet new challenges through innovation. The EU is the second largest producer of chemicals in the world with EUR 541 billion turnover in 2018 (7.0% of EU manufacturing by turnover) and 14.4% of global sales in 2020 (CEFIC, 2022)<sup>1</sup> and chemical manufacturing is the fourth largest industry in the EU comprising 30 000 companies, 95% of which are SMEs, directly employing approximately 1.2 million people and 3.6 million indirectly.\n\nAt the same time, chemicals can cause harm to human health and the environment. Certain chemicals cause cancers, affect the immune, respiratory, endocrine, reproductive and cardiovascular systems and increase vulnerability to diseases. Exposure to these harmful chemicals is therefore a threat to human health. In addition, the pollution of environment with chemicals is one of the key drivers putting the Earth at risk<sup>2</sup> , impacting and amplifying planetary crises such as climate change, degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity, examples being negative effects on pollinators, insects, aquatic ecosystems and bird population.\n\nIn order to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment from the adverse effects of chemicals and to support the efficient functioning of the internal market for chemicals while promoting the competitiveness and innovation of EU industry, the European Union has developed a comprehensive regulatory framework for chemicals.\n\nThe framework has been developed progressively, with the first legislation coming in place as early as in 1967. The framework consists currently of over 40 pieces of legislation, addressing: the **production and placing on the market of chemicals and chemical products, such as** (e.g. industrial chemicals, biocidal products, plant protection products, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products, detergents), **emissions of chemicals** (e.g. from industrial installations, waste water treatment plants or use of fertilisers), p**rotection of workers' health** (e.g. from carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxic substances, from asbestos, or from chemical agents in general), **chemicals in waste** (e.g. in general, in packaging and packaging waste or in end-of-life vehicles), **safety of consumer products** (e.g. toys, food contact materials, batteries), **safety of foodstuff and feedstuff** (e.g. food improvements agents or maximum residue levels of food contaminants ) and **protection of the environmental compartments (**e.g. surface waters, ground waters, marine waters, drinking water, air and soil).\n\nThe fitness check of the most relevant chemicals legislation assessing over 40 pieces of legislation concluded that overall the EU chemicals legislation delivers results as intended and is fit-for-purpose, but a number of significant weaknesses prevent the EU chemicals legislation from living up to its full potential. There were identified shortcomings across legislative pieces as regards the coherence of safety assessments, efficiency of the underlying technical and scientific work and the coherence of transparency rules. These shortcomings can lead to inconsistency and incoherence in safety assessments, slow procedures, inefficient use of resources, unnecessary burden, (perceived) lack of transparency and sometimes low quality of scientific advice (see section 2).\n\nBuilding on the findings of the fitness check, the [European Green Deal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN) announced the commitment '*to review how to use better the EU's agencies and scientific bodies to move towards a process of 'one substance, one assessment' and to provide greater transparency when prioritising action to deal with chemicals*'. The [Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A667%3AFIN) elaborated further on the concept of 'one substance, one assessment' and defined it as an approach to improve the overall efficiency, coherence and transparency of the delivery of safety assessments of chemicals across legislation. The strategy identified five key areas affecting the coherence and efficiency of delivery of safety assessments and for each of them defined number of specific\n\n<sup>1</sup> Within the EU, two thirds of these sales are generated in four Member States: Germany (32.1%), France (13.5%), Italy (10.7%) and the Netherlands (8.9%) (CEFIC, 2022). See Annex 18 for more information on the chemical sector in the EU.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Rockström, J. et al., Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity. Ecology and Society, 2009\n\nobjectives and actions (see sections 2 and 3). Two key actions identified are to 'rationalise the use of expertise and resources by **proposing the reattribution of technical and scientific work on chemicals performed under the relevant pieces of legislation to European agencies**, including work of the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) and Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS)' and to ensure 'a clear allocation of responsibilities and **good cooperation among the European Agencies**'.\n\nThe [EU Action Plan 'Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil'](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:a1c34a56-b314-11eb-8aca-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF) further contributed to the one substance, one assessment objectives through commitments to consolidate the roles of the European Environment Agency and the Commission's Joint Research Centre in close collaboration with the European Chemicals Agency, the European Food Safety Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency and other relevant agencies as the EU's Knowledge Centres of Excellence for Zero Pollution Monitoring and Outlook Framework.\n\nThe [European Parliament resolution](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0201_EN.pdf) of 10 July 2020 welcomed the Strategy and the 'one substance – one hazard assessment' principle in order to better use the resources of the Union's agencies and scientific bodies, avoid duplication of efforts, reduce the risk of diverging outcomes of assessments, speed up and bring consistency and transparency to chemicals regulation, and ensure enhanced health and environmental protection and a level playing field for industry. The resolution called to achieve coherence and synergies between legislation dealing with chemicals and chemical products, specific products regulation, general product legislation, legislation on environmental compartments, legislation on sources of pollution and legislation on waste. The resolution further called to pay special attention to reducing overlaps between legal frameworks, and between tasks allocated to the European Chemicals Agency, the European Food Safety Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The resolution also underlined the need to reinforce cooperation and coordination between the European evaluation agencies EFSA and ECHA together with national agencies, by developing common guidelines for risk assessment, namely for biocidal and phytopharmaceutical products, which take into account the most recent scientific results, so as to avoid inconsistencies. Finally, the European Parliament called on the Commission and Council to refrain from cutting ECHA's resources in annual budget procedures and to provide ECHA with additional resources for any other tasks that may be required, such as conducting evaluations of substances.\n\nThe [Council conclusions](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48827/st06941-en21.pdf) of 15 March 2021 also welcomed the Strategy and the 'one substance, one assessment' approach intending to simplify and improve the transparency of the regulatory framework for hazard and risk assessment of chemicals, to enhance coherence, to better coordinate the EU rules on chemicals, and to make decision-making faster. The conclusions called to continue ensuring policy coherence and exploit synergies among the chemicals and other policies. The conclusion further emphasised that the one substance, one assessment approach should not create delays in regulatory actions nor increase administrative burden, that the Member States are closely involved in the development of the approach and that the right of initiative of the Member States to initiate regulatory action is maintained*.* The conclusions also underlined the importance of allocating the necessary resources for the European agencies in the light of the envisaged re-attribution of technical and scientific work on chemicals, including an appropriate and long-term budgetary framework, and, in particular, for ECHA, taking into consideration their central role in the implementation of some key objectives of the Chemicals Strategy.\n\n## **1.2 Legal context**\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span><span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>The reattribution of existing tasks or attribution of new tasks to EU Agencies requires targeted amendments of the existing pieces of legislation on chemicals.

activities coordination tool' to provide an up-to-date overview of all planned and ongoing initiatives on chemicals by authorities across legislation;\n- develop a common open data platform on chemicals to facilitate the sharing, access and re-use of information on chemicals coming from all sources;\n- promote reuse and harmonisation of human and environmental health-based limit values among EU risk assessors and managers through a centralised and curated EU repository;\n- remove legislative obstacles for the re-use of data and better streamline the flow of chemical data between EU and national authorities;\n- establish tools and practices to ensure that relevant academic data is easily and readily accessible for safety assessments and is suitable for regulatory purposes;\n- enable EU authorities to commission testing and monitoring of substances as part of the regulatory framework when further information is considered necessary;\n- extend the principle of open data and the relevant transparency principles from the EU food safety sector to other pieces of chemical legislation;\n- develop an EU early warning and action system for chemicals to ensure that EU policies address emerging chemical risks as soon as identified by monitoring and research.\n\nIn order to implement these actions, the proposal also allocates some new tasks to EU agencies as regards the management, sharing and generation of data and information, operation of a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals and formalises some existing tasks.\n\n## **1.3 Scope of the

agencies and to ensure good cooperation among the EU agencies in the area of chemicals. The document accompanies the horizontal legislative proposals on reattribution of tasks to EU agencies, and explains changes in (re-)attributions proposed in those proposals. It also explains, for the purpose of completeness of information changes which will be made to allocation of tasks via revisions of individual pieces of legislation or via a new legislation, including via the proposal for a Regulation on establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals ('proposal for a regulation establishing a common data platform and a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals'). The document explains how the changes in allocation of tasks to EU agencies contribute to achieving the one substance, one assessment objectives and provides an assessment of cumulative impacts of the changes in allocations of tasks on the functioning of the EU Agencies.\n\n<sup>21</sup> Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the European Environment Agency and the European Information and Observation Network [\\(OJ L 126 21.5.2009, p.13\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02009R0401-20210729)\n\n<sup>20</sup> Regulation (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC [\\(OJ L 117 5.5.2017, p.1\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0745-20230320)\n\n<sup>22</sup> Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [\\(OJ L 031 1.2.2002, p.1\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02002R0178-20220701)\n\n<sup>23</sup> Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment [\\(OJ L 174 1.7.2011, p.88\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02011L0065-20230901)\n\n## <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span><span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>**2. PROBLEM DEFINITION**\n\nThe EU regulatory framework for hazard and risk assessment and management of chemicals is comprehensive. It consists of many pieces of legislation, addressing production and placing on the market of chemicals and chemical products, emissions of chemicals, chemicals in waste, protection of workers' health and safety of consumer products, foodstuff and feedstuff, and the environment. A high volume of technical and scientific work supports the implementation of the individual legislative acts. Depending on the legislation, the work is performed using different data and methodologies and involving various EU Agencies (the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA)), scientific committees, (ad hoc) expert groups, Commission services or external contractors. This situation may lead to inconsistent and incoherent outcomes of assessments across legislation (in respect of the same chemicals), inefficient use of resources and unnecessary costs (from operating several committees performing similar assessments, from assessing the same chemical by several committees/bodies or from duplicating supporting technical and scientific work). In addition, the assessments that are not performed by the EU Agencies are often being criticised by the stakeholders as not sufficiently transparent and inclusive, having insufficient scientific quality and robustness or having insufficient separation between risk assessment and risk management.\n\nImage /page/7/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram representing the concept of transparency in a process, structured like a building with columns supporting a roof. The roof is labeled \"TRANSPARENCY\" and includes the text \"Different rules and practices.\" The building has four columns labeled \"Initiation,\" \"Allocation,\" \"Data,\" and \"Methodologies.\" Under \"Initiation,\" the text lists \"Plethora of legislation,\" \"By COM, MSS, Industry,\" and \"At different time.\" Under \"Allocation,\" the text lists \"Agency,\" \"Expert group,\" \"Scientific Committee,\" and \"Consultant.\" Under \"Data,\" the text lists \"Availability,\" \"Formats,\" \"Access,\" and \"Quality.\" Under \"Methodologies,\" the text lists \"Guidelines\" and \"Guidance.\" The base of the building is labeled \"One substance, one assessment\" and includes the text \"Today.\"\n\nThe key drivers that one substance, one assessment approach intends to address are:\n\n- Assessments are initiated under various pieces of legislation, by various actors and at different points in time;\n- Assessments are performed by various agencies, scientific committees, expert groups or external consultants;\n- Assessments are using various data and they varies in their availability, accessibility, quality and are stored in different formats;\n- Assessments are using various methodologies and guidance documents;\n- Various transparency rules and practices are applied.\n\nThe key problems arising from these drivers that the legislative proposals on (re-)attribution of tasks to EU Agencies aim to address are:\n\n- multiple actors performing scientific and technical work;\n- varying degree of scientific robustness and procedural rigour of the actors performing scientific and technical work;\n- incoherent methodologies and guidance documents;\n- insufficient cooperation and coordination among the actors performing scientific and technical work on chemicals.\n\nThe other problems arising from these drivers are being addressed as part of other 'one substance, one assessment' legislative as well as non-legislative actions. For example, the problems related to complicated accessibility and availability of data underlying the assessments are being addressed by the proposal for a Regulation on establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals.\n\nThe problems have evolved as a consequence of the progressive development of the EU legislative framework for chemicals over the last 55 years and without this intervention, it will continue to persist.\n\n## <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>**3. OBJECTIVES: WHAT IS TO BE ACHIEVED?**\n\nThe general objective of one substance, one assessment approach and of this initiative is to ensure coherent, efficient and transparent delivery of safety assessments of chemicals across EU chemical legislation and thus contribute to a well-functioning single market for chemicals and a high level of protection of human health and the environment from chemicals.\n\nImage /page/8/Figure/2 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the concept of transparency in a process, likely related to assessment or regulation. The diagram is structured like a building, with \"TRANSPARENCY\" as the roof. Below the roof is a statement: \"Stakeholders are timely informed and have access to underlying data.\" The building has four pillars labeled \"Initiation,\" \"Allocation,\" \"Data,\" and \"Methodologies.\" Each pillar lists key aspects: Initiation includes synchronized and coordinated processes, and assessments of groups of substances. Allocation involves clear responsibilities, making the best use of available resources and expertise, and good governance and cooperation. Data should be easily findable, accessible, interoperable, secure, of high quality, and shared and reused by default. Methodologies should be coherent and harmonized to the extent possible, with hazard assessment centralized under CLP Regulation. The foundation of the building is labeled \"Tomorrow\" and states \"One substance, one assessment.\"\n\nThe specific objectives of the one substance, one assessment approach are:\n\n- Initiation or triggering of the assessments is to the extent possible synchronised and coordinated and substances are assessed in groups rather than substance-by-substance\n- Responsibilities for performing the assessment are clear and allocated to make the best use of available expertise and resources and there is a good cooperation among all players\n- Assessments have access to all available data without technical and administrative burden\n- Methodologies used are coherent and to the extent possible harmonised\n- There is a high level of transparency in performing assessments as well as in the underlying scientific data and information\n\nThe specific objectives of the legislative proposals on (re-)attribution of tasks to EU Agencies are one step to achieve the one substance, one assessment approach. They are to ensure that:\n\n- allocation of responsibilities for performing the assessments and the underlying technical and scientific work on chemicals is clear, exploits and maximises synergies and makes the best use of available expertise and resources;\n- there is a good cooperation among all players on all aspects underling the assessment of chemicals (such as methodology development and exchange of data);\n- the deliverables are of high scientific quality and the procedures are transparent and inclusive.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-1\"></span><span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>**4. AVAILABLE OPTIONS**\n\nConsidering the problem drivers and the specific objectives to be achieved, there is very little discretion on the main policy choices. The **preferred option** is clearly to **consolidate the technical and scientific work on chemicals performed under the relevant pieces of EU legislation in the EU Agencies** and to **strengthen the cooperation among the EU Agencies** as regards technical and scientific work on chemicals. The EU agencies have been founded as independent bodies with adequate funding, they maintain the necessary expertise, provide robust and high quality scientific work and follow transparent and inclusive procedures. Any other possible option (*e.g.* consolidation of work at other actors than EU Agencies or bringing all the existing actors at the same level of scientific robustness and procedural transparency and ensuring cooperation among them) would be less efficient, more expensive and provide less benefits.\n\nWhile the main policy option is clear and straightforward, there are sub-options as regards which tasks are suitable and useful to be reattributed to EU Agencies, which EU agency the (re-)attributed tasks should be assigned to and how and in which areas to strengthen the cooperation among the EU Agencies.\n\n#### *Guiding principles for (re-)attribution of scientific and technical work to EU Agencies*\n\nThe following guiding principles were developed and followed to identify tasks for (re-)attribution to EU Agencies and to decide as to which EU Agency the task should be assigned:\n\n1. The '**technical and scientific work on chemicals**' **is considered in a broad sense** and includes:\n\n- assessments of risk from, hazard of and exposure to chemicals;\n- monitoring of occurrence and emissions of chemicals;\n- determination of safe levels of chemicals for ecosystems and for humans;\n- development of guidance documents;\n- managing scientific committees, expert groups and network of experts;\n- collecting, analysing and hosting data and information on chemicals and associated processes;\n- hosting and operating (public) information platforms on chemicals;\n- managing the data flows on chemicals and defining data formats; and\n- assessments of socio-economic consequences/impacts of risk management measures on chemicals.\n- 2. The existing technical and scientific work on chemicals performed at EU level under, or in support of, **all relevant EU legislation is considered**. No legislation is a priory excluded.\n- 3. **Consider** attributing the scientific and technical work related to safety assessment of chemicals to one of the EU Agencies with a mandate related to chemicals, *i.e.* the European Chemicals Agency (**ECHA**), the European Food Safety Authority (**EFSA**), the European Medicine Agency (**EMA**), the European Environment Agency (**EEA**) or the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-**OSHA**);\n- 4. **Ensure fit with the core focus** of the EU Agencies' work on chemicals, in terms of use of substance in specific products, the route of exposure assessed, the type of sectors covered and mission of the agency.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <br>SCIENCE MEDICINES HEALTH                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                |                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Hazard, exposure and risk assessment of chemicals (except plant protection products and medicinal products) in all products except in food and feed and related products (food contact materials); Management of committees; Data collection, management | Hazard, exposure and risk assessment of plant protection products and chemicals in relation to food and feed safety; Management of committees and panels Data collection, management and IT tools | Hazard, exposure and risk assessment of medicinal products and of their residues in food; Management of committees and panels Data collection, management and IT tools | Collection and management of chemical occurrence data in the environment and emission data Assessment of state of environment Management of network of experts | Information on chemicals risks Tools for employers |\n\n- 5. **Maximize synergies and coherence** with ongoing activities, by attributing new activities on the basis of similarity with:\n  - Substances, data and data flows currently managed by the Agency;\n  - Existing expertise and competence;\n  - Output being provided by the Agency;\n  - Existing processes and procedures implemented by the Agency;\n  - Methodologies developed and applied by the Agency;\n  - Existing IT tools and planned developments;\n  - Networks of experts or committees governed or managed by the Agency.\n- 6. Strive that the (re-)attribution of tasks brings synergies and benefits to the Union beyond a mere shift of responsibilities.\n\n#### *Solutions to strengthen the cooperation among the EU Agencies*\n\nThe following solutions were identified for strengthening the cooperation among the EU Agencies:\n\n- 1. All agencies have equal legal obligations to cooperate with other agencies. The areas to be covered are those identified under the one substance, one assessment as affecting the coherence and efficiency of the assessments of chemicals, such as\n  - development of methodologies,\n  - development of formats and controlled vocabularies,\n  - exchange of data and information related to chemicals and their assessment.\n\n- 2. All agencies have a clear and equal mandate to develop methodologies for assessments related to chemicals in the fields falling within their mandate and to set formats and controlled vocabularies for data and information they hold.\n- 3. All agencies performing the assessment of chemicals should have an obligation to cooperate to prevent the divergent opinions and if divergent opinions appear, they should cooperate to solve it. A procedure for solving the divergent opinions should be specified.\n\nThe best results in terms of strengthening the cooperation among the EU Agencies and enabling coherence of scientific and technical work provided by the EU Agencies is achieved by implementing all three solutions. Requiring cooperation among the agencies on certain areas without providing a clear mandate for those areas would not achieve the desired objective. Providing a mandate to an agency for certain areas and not obliging the cooperation among agencies might lead to even more divergence.\n\n## <span id=\"page-10-0\"></span><span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>**5. STAKEHOLDER VIEWS**\n\nA call for evidence for the initiative on making best use of EU agencies to streamline scientific assessments was published on the Commission website ['Have your say'](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13161-Chemicals-making-best-use-of-EU-agencies-to-streamline-scientific-assessments_en) on 15 March 2022. The public and stakeholders were invited to provide feedback on this initiative until 12 April 2022. In total, 65 submissions were received. Most were from business associations and companies (in total around 70% of submissions), followed by submissions from EU citizens (11%), non-governmental organisations (6%), public authorities (6%), others (5 %) and academic/research institutions (1.5%). Generally, there was a large support of the initiative among the respondents, whether of the 'one substance, one assessment' approach as a whole or of the specific initiative on the reattribution of tasks. 67% of respondents expressed their explicit support, 23% did not expressed explicitly their opinion but provided relevant advices on how to develop the one substance, one assessment approach. About 10% expressed doubts about usefulness of the initiative or opposition to the initiative.\n\nAs the call for evidence was the first public consultation on an initiative under the one substance, one assessment, a lot of feedback received was not specific about the consulted initiative on the (re-)attribution of task to the EU Agencies but about the general scope of the one substance, one assessment approach as well as other initiatives announced under the one substance, one assessment. **Annex II** provides a summary of all the feedback received.\n\nStakeholders were also informed and consulted on the reattribution of tasks to EU agencies during the Information Session on One Substance, One Assessment with Stakeholders held on 1 June 2022. Some 800 participants followed this on-line event.\n\nAn extensive discussion on re-attribution of tasks to EU agencies was held with representatives of Member States and EU agencies at the meetings of the Expert Group on One Substance, One Assessment<sup>7</sup> held on 2-3 June 2022 and on 30 March 2023.\n\nRepresentatives of Member States and EU agencies participating in the expert group meetings were supportive to the initiative as well, providing concrete suggestions on the reattributions.\n\nThe feedback regarding the (re-)attribution of tasks to the EU agencies received from the call for evidence and from Member States and EU agencies during meetings of the Expert Group on One Substance, One Assessment can be grouped in 6 areas and summarised as follows:\n\n- *Level of centralisation:* Stakeholders and Member States suggested that re-attribution of work should not result in a single agency being responsible for the risk evaluations of all chemicals. The regulations must clearly set out the responsibilities of each agency.\n- *Expertise:* Stakeholders suggested that reattributing tasks should be done based on the existing expertise available in the agencies to ensure that the agency receiving the task benefits from the necessary expertise. It should be ensured that valuable expertise acquired by existing bodies is preserved. Expertise in risk assessment under the different regulations should stay with those agencies currently responsible for them. Each Agency is best positioned to lead and carry out specific assessments because of their extensive experience in product-specific matters, e.g., EFSA for food use and EMA for medicines use.\n- *Resources:* Member States insisted that the new tasks for the agencies must be accompanied by the required resources. Re-attributing work should not lead to an agency or a committee being unable to manage the workload and jeopardise the quality of the work.\n\n- *Organisation of scientific committees:* Member State indicated that the agencies' committees, especially of ECHA, might need to be reorganised to deal with increased workload, as the committee for risk assessment of ECHA has already now a high workload. Instead of creating new scientific panels or committees, the agencies should preferably reinforce and reuse the existing panels, committees and expert/working groups. In any event, safety assessments should be performed by an independent panel, independent committee or expert group that is independent.\n- *Tasks to re-attribute:* Some stakeholders and Member States suggested that the ECHA should be involved in hazard assessment as part of the assessment of food contact materials, and EFSA should be involved in risk assessments. The agencies should be involved in evaluating cosmetic ingredients, deriving environmental quality standards under the Water Framework Directive, and in opinions on chemical substances in products (for example in toys).\n- *Impact assessment:* A few respondents from stakeholders suggested to carry out an impact assessment on the one substance, one assessment initiative to ensure that possible impacts on businesses are considered sufficiently and that businesses are involved in developing the initiative.\n\n## <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span><span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>**6. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL WORK ON CHEMICALS FOR (RE-)ATTRIBUTION TO THE EU AGENCIES AND STRENGTHENING THE COOPERATION AMONG THE AGENCIES**\n\nScientific and technical work on chemicals for (re-)attribution to the EU Agencies have been identified under 36 pieces of legislation or work packages (see Table 1 below). The tasks for (re-)attribution have been identified through the targeted inter-service consultation including the EU Agencies, targeted consultation with Member States and targeted consultation with stakeholders and by applying the guiding principles for the (re- )attribution of scientific and technical work on chemicals to the EU Agencies (see section 4). The way how the tasks are (re-)attributed to the EU Agencies was discussed at length between the concerned Commission Service and the receiving Agency, taking into account the policy objectives, desired scientific rigour, scrutiny and technical and organisational feasibility. A particular attention was paid to the assessment of the proximity of a task for (re-)attribution with the Agency's mandate and to the identification of potential synergies and added value of the (re-)attribution.\n\nThere are various types of task (re-)attributions that have been proposed or are being considered (see 'task type' in Table 1). Reattribution of existing tasks from a non-agency body to the EU Agencies have been proposed or are being considered to be proposed under 12 pieces of legislation or work packages. Out of these 12 pieces of legislation or work packages, 3 contains reattributions that are accompanied with improvement or expansion of the reattributed tasks while 9 contains reattributions of tasks without their expansion. Attributions under 8 pieces of legislation or work packages are formalisation of the existing attributions of a task to an agency without a legal basis or are improvements of the specification of existing tasks. Attributions under 17 pieces of legislation or work packages contain tasks that are new. Either they are extension of the tasks that already exists at the agencies or they are completely new tasks.\n\nThe changes in the founding provisions of ECHA, EEA, EFSA and EMA to strengthen the cooperation among the agencies are listed here as a (re-)attribution, or improvement of the specification of existing tasks, under the respective founding regulations.\n\nThe (re-)attribution of tasks have been already adopted for 5 pieces of legislation / work packages, and it was proposed for another 8 pieces of legislation. The (re-)attributions are still to be proposed for 20 pieces of legislation/work packages and for 3 pieces of legislation the tasks are being defined and some of them might be suitable for attribution to the EU Agencies, but it is premature to conclude on this.\n\nFollowing the guiding principles, the highest number of tasks is to be (re-)attributed to ECHA, followed by EEA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA.\n\n|    | Legislation/work packages with tasks for (re-)attribution                                                                                 | Receiving body             | Task type

provisions for cooperation among the EU Agencies, is provided below (for detailed description see Annex III):\n\n# *1. Drinking water directive<sup>24</sup>*\n\nRevision of the drinking water directive in 2020 attributed **new tasks** to **ECHA**. ECHA is responsible for establishing and maintaining four EU positive lists for substances and compositions authorized to be used for the manufacturing of organic, cementitious, metallic and inorganic materials in contact with water intended for human consumption. ECHA first supports the Commission in compiling the first EU positive lists based on the national lists. Once established, ECHA will maintain the lists through the review of all the entries in the lists and then through the addition, removal and updating of the entries.\n\n# *2. Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health<sup>25</sup>*\n\nThe new regulation on serious cross-border threats to health **reattributed an existing task** performed by the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) to **ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA** and also to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. The regulation requires the agencies, on the request of the Commission, to carry out a risk assessment of the potential severity of the threat to public health, including possible public health measures when there is an alert of a cross-border threat of chemical origin. The responsibility for rapid risk assessment for risks of a cross-border threat that is linked to medicinal products and medical devices is assigned to the EMA, for risks of a cross-border threat of chemical origin is shared between the ECHA and the EFSA based on their mandate and for risk of a cross border threat of threats of environmental origin, including those due to the climate, are shared among the ECHA, the EFSA and the EEA based on their mandate. The agencies will have to set up and maintain a continuous readiness to provide rapid risk assessments and on the request provide the requested risk assessment.\n\n## *3. European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC)<sup>26</sup>*\n\nPARC is a 7-year partnership funded by Horizon Europe that started in May 2022 and aims to advance research, share knowledge and improve skills in chemical risk assessment. **ECHA, EEA** and **EFSA** took a **new task** to provide input and support to the project in order to ensure maximum links with and benefits for the regulatory risk assessments of chemicals.\n\n# *4. Commission implementing decision (EU) 2022/1979 under the SEVESO Directive<sup>27</sup>*\n\nThe commission implementing decision **reattributed an existing task** performed by the Commission (DG JRC) to **EEA**.

ECHA is required to continue operating the existing observatory for nanomaterials and extend its scope to chemicals and materials of potential emerging risk.\n\n## *29. Cooperation of ECHA with other EU agencies*\n\nThe proposal for the regulation on ECHA will consider proposing **a new task to ECHA** and **better specify the existing tasks**. ECHA should be given a formal mandate to develop methodologies for assessment of chemicals in the areas falling within its mission. ECHA should be required to actively cooperate with other EU Agencies as regards exchange of data and development of methodologies. Finally, ECHA should be further required to engage more in preventing or solving a divergent opinion with other EU Agencies. The goal is to ensure coherence, consistency and interoperability in the specified areas.\n\n#### *30. Scientific opinions on occupational exposure limits*\n\nThe proposal for the regulation on ECHA will consider to **formalise the existing task** of **ECHA**. ECHA and its Committee for Risk Assessment should be given a legal mandate to provide opinions on occupational exposure limits in support of the Directive on carcinogens, mutagen or reprotoxic substances at work, Chemical Agent Directive and Asbestos Directive.

ECHA and its committee should be also required to produce a technical guidance document concerning different aspects of testing and safety evaluation of cosmetic substances including for nanomaterials used is cosmetics.\n\n#### *33. Non-chemical assessments performed by SCHEER*\n\nThe Commission Decision on discontinuing the operation of scientific committees SCHEER and SCCS will result in **reattribution of existing tasks** to **the Commission Scientific Advisory Mechanism (SAM).** SAM will be required on the ad hoc basis to provide a scientific advice on non-chemical topics currently provided by SCHEER.\n\n#### *34. Ecodesign for sustainable products regulation 40*\n\nThe proposal for regulation on eco-design for sustainable products envisages some new tasks that could be potentially attributed to EU Agencies. These tasks are not defined in the proposal but rather to be specified in the envisaged implementing acts. Such envisaged tasks include involvement of ECHA in the development of a product passport that should hold also information on substances of concern.\n\n## *35. Tobacco products directive<sup>41</sup>*\n\nThe tobacco directive is undergoing an evaluation and a revision of the directive is being envisaged. As part of the revision, a new scientific and technical work is being envisaged that could be potentially attributed to EU Agencies. This includes managing the laboratory network on tobacco control, checking compliance with product presentation provisions, running the procedure determining characterizing flavour, updating negative/positive lists of additives, hosting product database and making publicly available the product information, monitoring of data in product notifications and assessing information on leaflets. The tasks are not yet clear but those that are being considered do not naturally fit to the agencies considered in this initiative.\n\n## *36. Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases<sup>42</sup> and the Regulation on ozone depleting substances<sup>43</sup>*\n\nThe proposal for a regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases establishes an obligation on the Commission to operate an electronic system for the management of the quota system, licensing of imports and exports and reporting and introduces invoicing fees for the quotas. Similarly for the Regulation on ozone depleting substance, the Commission has the obligation to operate a licencing and reporting system. It is not yet clear how the tasks can be implemented most effectively, but it is envisaged that an agency could take some of the tasks in case that would be deemed to be the best option at a later stage.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-19-0\"></span><span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>**7. ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS**\n\nThe fitness check of all chemical legislation (excluding REACH) assessed most of the challenges and risks addressed through this initiative and concluded that there are significant opportunities for streamlining the technical and scientific work through EU agencies. Moreover, there is little discretion of the policy choice as to achieve objectives of the initiative. The consolidation of the technical and scientific work on chemicals at the EU level is possible only in the EU Agencies. Therefore, no formal impact assessment was carried out.\n\n#### *Overall impact*\n\nAlthough no formal assessment of social, economic and environmental impacts was carried out, such impacts were qualitatively assessed by the Commission with the help of external consultants. The outcomes of the\n\n<sup>40</sup> Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125EC (COM (2022) 142 final).\n\n<sup>41</sup> [Evaluation of the legislative framework for tobacco control \\(europa.eu\\)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13481-Evaluation-of-the-legislative-framework-for-tobacco-control_en)\n\n<sup>42</sup> Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on fluorinated greenhouse gases, amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 (COM (2022) 150 final).\n\n<sup>43</sup> Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on substances that deplete the ozone layer and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (COM (2022) 151 final).\n\nassessment is provided in the sub section 'overall impact' of the section 8 for the legislative proposals on reattribution of tasks and of the section 9 for the legislative proposal for a regulation establishing a common data platform and a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals. The overall impacts from all reattributions are summarised in the section 10.1. 'added value and synergies of the (re-)attributions'.\n\n#### *Assessment of impacts on resources and committees of EU agencies*\n\nAs the (re-)attribution of tasks to EU agencies will have a major impacts on their resource and capacity needs, these impacts were assessed in great detail. Assessment of impacts of the (re-)attribution of each task to the EU Agencies included assessment of synergies and added value of the (re-)attribution, estimation of the impacts on Agencies' committees, data model and IT infrastructure and key experts and estimation of the workload and associated resource needs for the Agencies. For the existing tasks to be reattributed, the assessment also included description of the current workload and estimation of the current use of resources. The detailed assessment of impacts for each task per legislation or work package is provided in **Annex III**.\n\nThe estimation of the current resource use included an estimation of the full time equivalents dedicated to the tasks. This consisted of the estimation of the full time equivalent of the Commission staff as well as estimation of the full-time equivalents of the contracted staff (external and intramurous consultant, interim staff). To convert the cost of consultants into full time equivalents, the cost of 1 full time equivalent of a consultant was estimated based on the contracts and average Belgium salary at ca. EUR 66 000 annually<sup>44</sup>. It should be noted that the estimation of full-time equivalents for the Commission staff does not include administrative or IT overhead of the Commission.\n\nThe estimation of the resource needs for the Agencies was done in close and frequent consultation with the Agencies concerned. The operation of each (re-)attributed task to Agencies has been assumed to be done through implementing similar processes and similar level of scientific scrutiny and digitalisation to what is already in place for Agencies' current tasks. The benefit of this approach is to ensure a consistent standard of scientific quality, transparency and data interoperability as well as to maximise the reuse of existing processes and tools. In general, internal experts were assumed to be used for scientific and technical work underpinning assessments related to chemicals and the agencies' committees to be used to validate the work through provisions of opinions. External contracting was envisaged for the IT development as well as for the collection of data or information.\n\nECHA is the agency to receive most of the assessment work on chemicals. The estimation of the resource needs for the new assessment task to be allocated to ECHA was built on the ECHA's experience of the resource needs for their existing processes. The experience shows that resource requirement for the development of an opinion on harmonised classification varies between 0.35 – 0.65 FTEs per dossier (0.35 for low complexity dossier, 0.5 for average complexity and 0.65 FTE for complex dossier), for scientific opinion on the occupational exposure limit values is average of 0.7 FTE per dossier, for opinion on REACH authorisation is 0.15 FTE pre dossier of low complexity up to 0.35 FTE per dossier of high complexity, for opinion on REACH restriction is 1 FTE per dossier of low complexity up to 1.5 FTE per dossier of high complexity. An overhead of 15% was added to the resource estimate for the development and maintenance of common IT components and additional 15% for the contribution to the horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead).\n\n#### <span id=\"page-20-0\"></span><span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>**8. IMPACTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ON REATTRIBUTION OF TASKS**\n\n#### *Overall impact*\n\nOverall, this proposal is expected to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, coherence and transparency of EU processes for chemical assessments for the benefit of all stakeholders. Citizens and the environment will benefit from better protection from dangerous chemicals as a result of more efficient and effective assessment processes. Companies will benefit from more harmonised and transparent processes across legislation, from a\n\n<sup>44</sup> This number corresponds to a medium to high BE annual salary cost (see e.g. [An overview of Belgian wages and](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/work-training/wages-and-labourcost/overview-belgian-wages-and-salaries)  [salaries | Statbel \\(fgov.be\\)\\)](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/work-training/wages-and-labourcost/overview-belgian-wages-and-salaries); Belgian average salaries were used because many companies contracted by the Commission are based on Belgium.\n\nreduced number of bodies involved in safety and risk assessments, as well as from strengthened certainty regarding the validity of assessments. Finally, the national and EU authorities will benefit from improved efficiency of delivery of assessments and improved public trust and acceptance of regulatory decisions.\n\n- **Improved scientific consistency and coherence of assessments** *–* The reduced number of actors involved in the scientific and technical work, as well as an increased cooperation and obligation to solve divergent opinions among agencies leads to improved coherence and scientific consistency - both across the various Union acts, and across the assessment processes laid out therein. The consolidation of work allows to better align priority setting, timelines, processes, and methodologies used for the assessments. It facilitates re-use of assessment insights developed under one Union act on chemicals in the assessment process of another.\n- **Improved robustness of assessment, trust and acceptance of regulatory decisions** *–* The involvement of the EU agencies and their committees in the scientific and technical work on chemicals adds more scientific expertise, ensures high quality of scientific advice and leads to improved robustness of assessments and thus their acceptance.\n- **Strengthen independence of the scientific advice** Moving scientific and technical work on chemicals from the Commission, ad hoc committees or consultants to EU agencies and their committees reinforces the independence of the scientific advice and the separation between science and policy or between risk assessment and management. Agencies are independent and their committees work under stricter conflict of interest avoidance rules, improving guarantees of independent scientific advice to the Commission.\n- **Improved transparency** The involvement of the EU agencies in scientific and technical work will ensure transparency to the process in terms of overall process transparency.\n- **Improved efficiency of delivery of assessments** Centralising assessment work in the EU agencies will allow the re-use of capabilities, the re-use of knowledge and experience, and the re-use of IT tools and support services.\n\n#### *Impact on resources of Agencies and the Commission*\n\nThe proposal for a directive on reattribution of tasks will amend RoHS directive to reattribute the assessment work under this directive to ECHA. The proposal for a regulation on reattribution of tasks will amend 2 legislative pieces (POPs Regulation and Medical devices regulation) to reattribute the assessment work under these pieces of legislation to ECHA and it will amend the EEA founding regulation and the general food law (EFSA founding regulation) to ensure better cooperation among agencies on methodology development and on exchange of data. In summary for these two proposals on reattribution, in the first year, there will be a need of **4 FTEs** (**4 TAs**) and operational costs of **EUR 101 000** per year and as of the second year, there will be a need of **9 FTEs (6 TA + 3 CA)** per year and operational budget of **EUR 83 000 per year**. All new resources are needed for ECHA, no additional resources are needed for EEA and EFSA. Considering the resources currently used for the tasks to be reattributed, there will be a total **net increase** in the resources from 2026 and beyond as compared to today of **4.5 FTEs** per year and **EUR 59 000 per year**.\n\n**Table 2.

For this work, ECHA will require in the first year 3 FTEs (3 TAs) and operational budget of EUR 66 000 and as of the second year 7 FTEs (4 TAs + 3 CAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 33 000 per year. The work is currently performed with the help of consultants and amounts to approximately 2.74 FTE per year (ca. EUR 145 000 annually for outsourcing the review of exemptions (ca. 2.2 FTEs/years) + ca. EUR 180 000 every 5 years for contracts to review restrictions (ca. 0.54 FTE/year)). DG ENV uses ca. 1.5 FTE of core staff for overall RoHS implementation, which will need to continue. The resources currently spent are however insufficient leading to the accumulation of requests for exemptions without processing them to the legal drafting (by December 2022, over 60 exemption requests were pending) and the revision of the restriction was delayed (the review not finalised although it has started in 2018). There are also complaints about the quality and robustness of the assessments, the transparency of the process and involvement of stakeholders. The reattribution to ECHA and using its processes will address these shortcomings and will ensure alignment with other chemicals legislation.\n\n**Changes to POPs regulation** will reattribute the technical assistance in reviewing Annexes IV and V to ECHA and hosting the POPs monitoring data to EEA. For this work, ECHA will require in the first year 1 FTE (1 TA) and operational budget of EUR 35 000 and as of the second year 2 FTEs (2 TAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 50 000 per year. No resources are needed for EEA. The work on reviewing the Annexes IV and V is currently performed by the Commission with the help of consultants and amounts to approximately 1.5 FTEs per year (EUR 300 000 for consultants every 3 years (=1.5 FTE/year)). DG ENV uses ca. 0.5 FTE/year of core staff for implementing the review of Annexes IV and V, which will however need to continue. The involvement of ECHA and its Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis is envisaged to provide a significant increase in the scientific quality, the consistency, the robustness and the level of independence of the assessments upon which the Commission develops its proposals on this matter. The hosting of chemicals monitoring data under the POPs regulation is currently done by the Commission. Transfer of this work to EEA will require no additional resources, as POPs monitoring data in waters are to be reported to EEA under the water legislation and resources for that were proposed in the recent proposal, the POPs monitoring data in air are already being reported to EEA as part of the air quality legislation and covered by resources for that activity. In addition, hosting of any additional data sets in the environment is also covered in the resource for common data platform.\n\n**Changes to medical devices regulation** will not require any additional resources for ECHA. The work is currently performed by the Commission supported by the SCHEER committee. The current resource use is estimated to be 0.3 FTE per year and EUR 24 000 per year (DG SANTE SCHEER secretariat 0.3 FTE (ca. 10% of SCHEER secretariat work), EUR 24 000 per year for indemnities, travel, e.g. costs for members of the committee). DG SANTE uses (policy unit) uses ca. 0.1 FTE of core staff per year for implementation of the related provisions, which will however need to continue. Considering that the envisaged frequency of the work is very low, the involvement of the Committees is only where necessary and the first work will likely materialise only in 2029, the work can be absorbed by ECHA without any additional resources.\n\n**Changes to the regulation on the European Environment Agency and to the regulation on the general principles and requirements of food law and establishing the European Food Safety Authority** will have no resource implications. The provisions formalise the activities already performed, they prescribe the procedural steps to follow and they enable the implementation of the proposal for a regulation establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals. Any possible resource needs stemming from these provisions can be absorbed by the existing resources of the agencies.\n\n#### *Impact on committees of Agencies*\n\nThere will be an impact on ECHA's committees for risk assessment and for socio-economic analysis. It is estimated that the **committee for risk assessment** will have to process *ca.* **4 opinions per year**: one opinion on new restriction of a substance (which is of equivalent of low complexity restriction under REACH) and 3 opinions per year on requests for new exemptions (which is expected to be lighter dossier than the low complexity restriction dossier under REACH) under RoHS. The **committee for socio-economic analysis** is expected to process *ca.* **33 opinions per year**: 1 opinion on restriction of a substance and 30 opinions on the requests for exemption under RoHS, and 2 opinions on the revision of Annex IV and V and the proposed limit value under the POPs regulation.\n\n|                              | RAC | SEAC |\n|------------------------------|-----|------|\n| RoHS directive               |     |      |\n| - Restriction                | 1   | 1    |\n| - Request for exemption      | 3   | 30   |\n| POPs regulation              |     |      |\n| - Review of Annexes IV and V | -   | 2    |\n| SUM                          | 4   | 33   |\n\n#### <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span><span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>**9. IMPACT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION ESTABLISHING A COMMON DATA PLATFORM AND A MONITORING AND OUTLOOK FRAMEWORK FOR CHEMICALS**\n\n#### *Overall impact*\n\nOverall, this proposal is expected to contribute to an improvement of the efficiency, coherence, quality and transparency of chemicals assessments under EU legislation as well as to the early identification of emerging chemicals risks. It will therefore improve the protection of human health and the environment from chemicals, for the benefit of Member State authorities, stakeholders and citizens. In addition, the initiative simplifies access to chemicals information for everyone (citizens, industry, national authorities, EU agencies, the Commission) thus increasing transparency. Moreover, it will improve predictability and thus the possibility for the industry, national authorities and EU agencies to plan – and where relevant coordinate – their activities:\n\n• Bringing together chemicals data in one common data platform will increase findability and simplify access, which is beneficial for all users. The platform will operationalise the ambition of the onesubstance one-assessment approach, supporting quality and mutual coherence of chemicals assessments. The use of standard formats and controlled vocabularies will enhance interoperability of information, thus increasing its findability. In addition, information across regulatory dossiers will be easier to compare. An increased findability and comparability will in turn reduce administrative burden for risk assessors, which include national administrations, and have a positive impact on the effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of chemical safety assessments.\n\n- Through the extended utility of shared information in the common data platform, this proposal will help minimise potential duplication of efforts and optimise data generation strategies. With an increased volume and transparency of data on chemical properties and supported by adequate context data that enables the responsible use of that chemicals data, compliance with and enforcement of existing obligations should be facilitated.\n- Building on integrated access and services the common data platform is expected to provide additional insight into effective risk management measures and to facilitate the search for safe and sustainable alternatives, leading to improvements in the protection of human health and the environment.\n- Bringing together chemicals data and being allowed to use it will increase the knowledge base for scientific assessments and opinions, thus improving their robustness. This will in turn increase the acceptance by society of conclusions and regulatory decisions. Knowing through the notification of studies that all studies have been considered in an assessment further strengthens the trust of citizens in regulatory decisions.\n- A dedicated service in the common data platform related to information on regulatory processes planned or ongoing by the Commission, EU agencies and Member States will improve the coordination of activities, which in turn will allow better planning for the authorities and agencies involved, thus increasing efficiency. That information will also allow better predictability and planning for industry, facilitating receipt of comprehensive but also consistent input to the activities, where required. It will be easier for industry but also other stakeholders to know when and how to contribute to regulatory processes.\n- A dedicated service in the common data platform related to obligations under EU legal acts on chemicals will be very valuable for industry, and in particular for SMEs and microenterprises, to easily get an overview of their legal obligations, which will give them certainty on what exactly their duties are. Acting with such full knowledge in turn supports compliance and correspondingly reduces burden on national authorities.\n- The establishment of a monitoring and outlook framework including an early warning and action system for emerging chemical risks will allow to shorten the reaction time between early signals of risks and regulatory measures to reduce those rusks, and as such will lead to an improved protection of human health and the environment.\n- The establishment of a data generation mechanism allows the commissioning of studies when there are no legal provisions to obtain them. This will contribute to the creation of a complete knowledge base.\n\nThe establishment and operation of the platform will not impose any costs on industry. Economic operators will continue to have to fulfil their legal obligations as they are doing today under the relevant specific pieces of legislation. Economic operators and laboratories will experience some administrative burden linked to the requirement to submit a notification when a study is intended to be commissioned or carried out. Quantified costs associated with the notification obligation are set out in the staff working document accompanying this proposal<sup>45</sup> .\n\nThe establishment of the platform will be associated with significant costs for the EU agencies, but they should principally be seen as investment in technical progress within the data economy, enhancing the value of existing and future data. The task requires investment in entirely new data structures and IT\n\n<sup>45</sup> Commission staff working document accompanying the document Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals.\n\nsystems/capabilities, principally on the ECHA's side, but also on the side of other EU agencies as data source owners who are to prepare datasets for integration in the platform.\n\n#### Impact on resources of Agencies and the Commission\n\nThe legislative proposal for a regulation establishing a common data platform and a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals consists of 10 distinct activities that will have an impact on the resource needs of ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA and the Commission. The first three years there will be a need for up to **32 FTEs** (**12 TA + 20 CA**) **per year** and an operational budget of up to **EUR 8 657 000 per year**. In the fourth year and beyond, there will be a need of **20 FTEs** (**12 TAs and 8 CA**) per year and **EUR 7 080 000** per year. Considering the resources currently used for the existing tasks to be reattributed (i.e. resources for IPCHEM), there will be a total **net increase** in the resources in the fourth year and beyond as compared to today of **15.5 FTEs** per year and operational budget of **EUR 7 080 000 per year**.\n\n| Table 5.

The work will include development and operation of the infrastructure and the governance and provision of data into the platform. The principal aim of new IT infrastructure operating as part of the Green Deal Data Space is to support effective and coherent chemical safety assessments. It shall provide integrated, user-differentiated and highly functional access to chemicalsrelated datasets owned or managed by EU agencies and provide space for the dedicated services supporting EU chemicals policy and legislative implementation. The work will require resources for 4 agencies involved and the Commission (JRC). The resource requirement is higher for the first 3 years to set up the infrastructure and all the underlying processes to share the data and make them interoperable and in adequate formats. This will require for the first 3 years:\n\n- for ECHA, 10 FTEs (4 TAs + 6 CAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 0 for the first year, EUR 2 226 000 for the second year and EUR 2 793 000 for the third year;\n- for EEA, 3 FTEs (1 TA + 2 CAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 0 for the first year, EUR 266 000 for the second year and EUR 334 000 for the third year;\n- for EFSA, 5 FTEs (5 CAs) per year and an operational budget of EUR 670 000 per year;\n- for EMA, 3 FTEs (3 CAs) per year and an operational budget of EUR 100 000 per year;\n- for EU-OSHA, 0 FTEs per year and operational budget of EUR 0 per year;\n- for JRC, an operational budget of EUR 180 000 per year to cover integration of IPCHEM in the common data platform and handing over of IPCHEM operation to ECHA.\n\nAfter the initial phase of 3 years, the resource requirement is reduced to maintain the infrastructure and the underlying processes. This phase will require\n\n- for ECHA, 4 FTEs (4 TAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 600 000 per year;\n- for EEA, 1 FTE (1 TA) per year and operational budget of EUR 200 000 per year;\n- for EFSA, 2 FTEs (2 CAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 500 000 per year;\n- for EU-OSHA, 0 FTEs per year and operational budget of EUR 0 per year;\n- for EMA, 2 FTEs (2 CAs) per year and operational budget of EUR 0.\n\n**Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring** (IPCHEM) will be formally established and its operation will be reattributed to the Agencies. For this work,\n\n• ECHA will need as of the second year 2 FTEs (1 TA + 1 CA) per year and as of the third year operational budget of EUR 180 000 per year;\n\n• EEA will need as of the first year 1 FTE (1 TA) per year and the operational budget in the first year EUR 0, in the second year EUR 200 000, in the third year EUR 200 000 and as of the fourth year EUR 50 000 per year.\n\nThe operation of IPCHEM is currently done by the Commission and the resource use accounts for total of 4.5 FTEs/year (DG JRC staff 2.5 FTEs/year + IT experts intramurous 2 FTEs/year (EUR 130 000/year)). The operation of IPCHEM will be entrusted to ECHA which will also integrate it into the Common Data Platform. As this work will be reattributed to ECHA, the resources at the Commission's side will be saved. Hosting of data will be entrusted to the Agencies based on their mandates (ECHA will host occupational data) and EEA will host indoor air data and collect and host human biomonitoring data. EFSA already provides data to IPCHEM and contributes to its operation and will not require any additional resources to continue in this activity. EMA and EU-OSHA currently do not systematically collect or receive data relevant for IPCHEM and therefore will not require any additional resources.\n\n**Database containing information on regulatory processes on chemicals** will be established on the basis of existing (public) activities coordination tool ((P)ACT) and enlarging its scope to cover all relevant legislation with safety assessment processes and initiatives to promote coordination of safety assessment activities across EU legislation and provide transparency on the ongoing assessments. This work will impact ECHA, EEA, EFSA and EU-OSHA but will not require additional resources for the agencies. ECHA already operates (P)ACT for REACH, CLP and POPs processes. EFSA already operates OpenEFSA which has similar level of information as PACT for food and feed legislation. Resources for the operation and continuous provision of information are to be absorbed by the Agencies as part of the existing processes. EEA and EU-OSHA are currently not involved in any processes relevant for the database, therefore no resources are required for them. The development and coordination of the system is covered by the resources provided for the common data platform.\n\n**Repository of reference values** will be established to promote the reuse of existing reference values and thus improve coherence of assessments and reduce repetition of deriving reference values. The proposal will impact ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA, EU-OSHA and the Commission. To perform the required work, ECHA will need as of the first year 1 FTE (1 TA) per year and operational budget of EUR 0 in the first year, EUR 650 000 in the second year, EUR 650 000 in the third year and as of the fourth year EUR 200 000 per year. No additional resources will be needed for EEA, EFSA, EMA, EU-OSHA or the Commission. ECHA has developed and operates the EU Chemicals Legislation Finder (EUCLEF). EUCLEF lists some regulatory reference values derived and applicable under these legislative pieces. ECHA will have to collate the 'old scientific reference values' which can be done via contracting. The new scientific reference values will be provided to the repository progressively as part of ECHA's assessment processes. ECHA will require additional resources for developing, operating and maintain the repository, being in contact with data providers. EFSA has developed and is maintaining the OpenFoodTox database that summarises the scientific reference values derived by EFSA as part of its assessment activities. EFSA will continue its activity and will provide the information to the new repository as part of its existing resources. Therefore, no additional resources are required. EMA will need to provide to the new repository on continuous basis all new predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) derived for human and veterinary medicinal products after entry into force of this legislation. This can be done efficiently as part of EMA's future assessment activities. In addition, this can be automatized for human medicines as digitalisation of environmental risk assessment is foreseen as part of the revision of human medicinal product legislation. Therefore, no additional resources are required. EEA and EU-OSHA currently do not hold any relevant data for the repository. Therefore, no additional resources are required.\n\nThe establishment and operation of a **database with information on applicable laws and legal obligations** applicable to chemicals under Union legislation to promote compliance will be formalised. This work will impact ECHA but will not require additional resources under this proposal. ECHA already operates EU chemical legislative finder (EUCLEF) as part of the contribution agreement with DG GROW. The contribution agreement amounts to ca. EUR 1.0 – 1.4 million annually. ECHA runs the service through the employment of 4 interim staff members (ca. EUR 270 000/year) and via contractors: communication activities and external helpdesk ca. EUR 60 000/year, IT costs EUR 200 000/year, data costs EUR 430 000/year. These existing resources will be used to continue operating, further developing and slightly expanding the system. The resources for major extension of the system, such as the repository of reference values, are provided under the work on repository of reference values. Although no resources are required under this proposal, the legislative proposal for a regulation on ECHA should address the fact that the operation of the EUCLEF became a structural task for ECHA and that the financing should become part of the annual contribution to ECHA.\n\nDatabase on **environmental sustainability related data on chemicals** will be established. The work will impact ECHA. ECHA will be required to set up the database, operate it, establish and maintain the flows of adequate data into the database and provide interpretation of data. Other agencies (EEA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA), if they host environmental sustainable data on chemicals, will provide that data to ECHA. To perform the work, ECHA will need as of the second year 1 FTE (1 TA) per year and operational budget of EUR 0 per year. Other agencies will not need additional resources as their task is small, currently do not hold any relevant data and the potential work can be absorbed by the agencies' current resources.\n\n**Data generation mechanism** will be established to allow ECHA and the Commission to commission studies supporting the implementation of Union chemicals legislation within ECHA's mandate or contributing to the development of Union chemicals policy. The studies can be commissioned only when results cannot be obtained through existing legal provisions and they shall not have predominant research and development objective. The mechanism will allow ECHA and the Commission to generate data where needed and cannot be obtained otherwise. ECHA's involvement is necessary as commissioning of such studies requires technical expertise. To perform the work, ECHA will require in the first year 1 FTE (1 TA) and operational budget of EUR 0, in the second year 2 FTEs (1 TA and 1 CA) and operational budget of EUR 1 000 000, in the third year 2 FTEs (1 TA and 1 CA) and operational budget of EUR 3 000 000 and as of the fourth year 2 FTEs (1 TA and 1 CA) per year and operational budget of EUR 5 000 000 per year. No current process exists, but there is a complementary process operated by EFSA for the food sector (4 FTEs/year, EUR 15 000 000/year). This will continue to be operated next to the new one and the two Agencies (ECHA and EFSA) are required to cooperate when commissioning such studies and develop a joint plan.\n\nThe **obligation to notify studies** before they start will be expanded from food sector to all chemical sector. The work will require additional resource for ECHA. ECHA will need as of the first year 3 FTEs (1 TA and 2 CAs) per year and operational budget in the first year of EUR 0, in the second year EUR 1 200 000, in the third year EUR 400 000 and as of the fourth year EUR 200 000 per year. ECHA will be required to develop the database, operate it, facilitate and check compliance with the provisions and provide feedback to the duty holders. EFSA already operates a database of notification of studies to serve the obligation under the food sector legislation. The resource use amounts to 2 FTEs/year and EUR 400 000/year. EFSA and ECHA will be required to ensure compatibility of the systems. No additional resources are needed for this for EFSA.\n\nThe operation of the **indicators framework for chemicals** will be formalised and an **early warning and action system for chemicals** will be established**.** The work will require additional resources for EEA. EEA will need as of the first year 1 FTE (1 TA) per year and operational budget for the first year of EUR 0, for the second year EUR 300 000 and as of the third year EUR 150 000 per year. EEA and ECHA already jointly develop the indicators framework for chemicals as part of the commitment under the 8th Environment Action Programme. As the resources for indicator framework (2 FTEs per year for ECHA, 1 FTE per year for EEA) were already attribution as part of the 8th EAP, no additional resources are needed for this work. The establishment of the early warning and action system is a new, non-existing task that aims to significantly shorten the regulatory response to identified risks. The EEA will be tasked to collect early warning signals from other agencies, Member State and by its own activity and compile annually a report for discussion and decision on the follow up with Member States authorities. Other contributing agencies (ECHA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA) will absorb the costs as part of exiting activities. In case of ECHA, the resources attributed for the indicator framework will be partly used to support the EEA by generating relevant early warning signals.\n\n**Observatory for specific chemicals with potential contribution to emerging chemical risks** will be established**.** This will de facto formalise the operation of existing EU Observatory for nanomaterials and extend its scope to specific chemicals considered to benefit from additional scrutiny and reliable information on their properties, safety aspects, uses and market presence. This work will impact ECHA but will not require additional resources under this proposal. ECHA operates the EU Observatory for nanomaterials as part of a contribution agreement with DG GROW. The resource use amounts to approximately EUR 700 000 per year including the 3 FTEs (3 CA). These existing resources will be used to continue operating, further developing and slightly expanding the system. The legislative proposal in preparation for a regulation on ECHA should address the fact that the operation of the EUCLEF became a structural task for ECHA and that the financing should become part of the annual contribution to ECHA.\n\n## *Impact on committees of Agencies*\n\nThere is no or a low impact of this proposal on committees of ECHA, EFSA and EMA and on the network of EEA. The rapporteurs of ECHA, EFSA and EMA committees that derive reference values will have to record the reference values and associated metadata into the repository of reference values or structure this information in the opinion to enable automatic extraction of that information to the repository. In addition, ECHA committees might be required to provide their suggestions for testing and monitoring of substances. The network of EEA will be required to assist in the collection of human biomonitoring data and early warning signals from member countries activities. There is no impact of this proposal on advisory groups of EU-OSHA.\n\n## **10. OVERALL IMPACTS FROM ALL (RE-)ATTRIBUTIONS**\n\n# **10.1 Added value and synergies of the (re-)attributions**\n\n#### *Added value*\n\nThe consolidation of scientific and technical work in the EU agencies provides for several benefits:\n\n- 1. Scientific consistency and coherence *-* Less actors involved in the scientific and technical work, centralising the work in the Agencies and requiring the Agencies to cooperate and solve possible divergent opinions leads to improved coherence and scientific consistency among the legislative pieces and among the assessments. The consolidation of work allows to better align priority setting, timelines, processes and methodologies used for the assessments. It facilitates reuse of assessment insights developed under one piece of chemical legislation in the assessment under another piece of legislation. It also facilitates the reuse of data collected under one piece of chemical legislation in the assessment under another piece of legislation. It contributes to alignment of data formats, IT solutions, data storing practices and thus contribute to improved interoperability of data.\n- 2. Robustness of assessment and acceptance *-* Involvement of the EU agencies and their committees in the scientific and technical work on chemicals adds more scientific expertise, ensures high quality of scientific advice and leads to improved robustness of assessments and thus their acceptance. Centralising data on chemicals in the EU Agencies will increase the knowledgebase and improve the robustness of the scientific advice provided. Re-use of (same) data will further facilitate acceptance of conclusions.\n- 3. Independence Moving scientific and technical work on chemicals from Commission services, ad hoc committees or consultants to EU agencies and their committees reinforces the separation between science and policy or between risk assessment and management. Agencies and their committees work under stricter conflict of interest avoidance rules, improving guarantees of independent scientific advice to the Commission.\n- 4. Transparency Involvement of the EU agencies in scientific and technical work will ensure transparency to the process in terms of\n  - overall process transparency;\n  - publication of regulatory intentions of EU authorities and application submission intentions improves predictability for all stakeholders;\n  - public consultation/call for evidence;\n  - stakeholder involvement/observer status;\n  - dissemination of scientific data and outcomes.\n\nThe increased transparency will further increase the acceptance of the outcomes and trust in the regulatory system.\n\n#### *Synergies*\n\nThe EU agencies already perform similar work to the work that is to be (re-)attributed to them. The consolidation of scientific and technical work in the EU agencies therefore provides for number of synergies:\n\n- 1. Reuse of capabilities The existing agencies' capabilities, such as hazard, risk and exposure assessment, development of committee opinions, development of methodologies, IT capabilities for submission of information by industry and Member States, collection and processing of data, stakeholder consultations, dissemination, can be reused in performing the (re-)attributed tasks.\n- 2. Reuse of data, information and knowledge The information collected by the agencies on substances under one piece of legislation can be reused under other pieces of legislation. The knowledge on a substance developed under one piece of legislation can be reused under other legislation.\n- 3. Workload balancing More similar work consolidated at one place allows for better balancing the workload across the year and thus better using existing capacities at the Agencies.\n- 4. IT tools: automation and economies of scale Existing IT tools of the Agencies after some adaptation of the tools or the processes can be reused to support the tasks to be reattributed to the Agencies. This includes data submission and reporting tools, tools for case management, public consultation, interaction with Member States, regulatory intentions management and data dissemination\n- 5. Support services: economies of scale Existing scientific support services (such as committee secretariat, prioritisation and grouping of substances, substance identification, data management and dissemination) and administrative services of the agencies can be reused to support the tasks to be (re-)attributed to the agencies.\n\n## **10.2 Overall impact on resources**\n\n#### *Overall impact on resources per legislation and per agency*\n\nThe (re-)attribution of scientific and technical work on chemicals to the EU Agencies with accompanying resources has been already proposed under 8 legislative proposals and one research cooperation action. The accompanying resources already attributed to the EU agencies following legislative initiatives already proposed by the Commission and some of which are already adopted by the co-legislator vary per year (see Table 8), with **54 FTEs (42 TA + 12 CA)** and **EUR 2 260 000** in **2024**, **76 FTEs (63 TA + 13 CA)** and **EUR 1 873 000** in **2025**, **92 FTEs (79 TA + 13 CA)** and **EUR 1 726 000** in **2026** and **98 FTEs (88 TA + 10 CA)** and EUR **1 463 000** in **2027**. The majority of resources were allocated to EMA (42 – 60 FTEs per year), followed by ECHA (24 – 29 FTEs and EUR 1 257 000 – EUR 1 364 000 per year) and EEA (9 – 11 FTEs and EUR 180 000 – EUR 919 000 per year). The majority of resources proposed for EMA are not related to the scope of the one substance, one assessment, but to improvement of processes for authorisation of medicinal products for human use.\n\n| Table 8.

As the resource allocation is still pending, these initiatives are mentioned in the table with pending resource needs below.\n\nThe re-attribution of tasks to the EU agencies is still to be proposed under 5 upcoming legislative proposals and under the reattribution of non-chemical assessment work from SCHEER to SAM within the Commission. After considering all possible synergies from the reattributions, the pending resource needs for the work attributed to the EU Agencies without the resources and for the work to be attributed varies between **56 – 69 FTEs (34-38 TA + 19-31 CAs)** per year and operational budget of **EUR 1 051 000 – EUR 10 300 000** per year. The details are provided in Table 10.

An additional 48 FTEs are necessary in the long term to deal with the envisaged tasks that were already proposed by the Commission but without allocation of resources or are still to be proposed (see Table 15). Although the required reinforcement of ECHA seems significant, the allocation of 11 FTEs out of 48 will be de facto a regularisation of resources that already exist in ECHA via administrative agreements (4 FTEs for worker protection legislation and 3 FTEs for operation of EUON) or via a service level agreement (4 interim employees for operation of EUCLEF). In addition, the allocation of some additional 11 FTEs is a reattribution from other sources, mainly from contracting out the support (2.7 FTEs for RoHS directive, 1.5 FTEs for POPs regulation, 0.3 FTEs for medical devices, 3.5 FTEs for IPCHEM, 3 FTEs for cosmetics regulation, 0.3 FTEs for toy safety directive and 0.36 FTEs for end-of-life vehicle directive).\n\n| Table 14.

One exception is the extension of the scope of assessments for waste stage under the batteries regulation, RoHS directive, directive on end-of-life vehicles, packaging and packaging waste directive and POPs regulation, for which ECHA will need to build or recruit additional expertise. ECHA will also need to acquire a new expertise as regards water monitoring and derivation of water quality standards. ECHA will further need to build expertise on the assessment of chemicals in materials coming in contract with drinking water, where assessment is similar to food contact materials managed by EFSA.\n\n#### *Impact on ECHA's committees*\n\nThe estimated number of opinions per year from (re-)attribution of tasks is provided in the table below. It is expected that **RAC** will have to deliver additional **80 opinions** per year as compared to today, while **SEAC** additional **50 opinions** per year. The increase in number of RAC opinions represents 72% increases as compared today. It should be noted that the biggest increase comes from drinking water directive (50 opinions) and from CLP regulation (13.5 opinions). The rest of legislations accounts for just 16.5 opinions. In order to cope with increased workload, the RAC will require some adaptation aiming on increasing the number of committee members (currently RAC membership is at 50% capacity), attractiveness of rapporteurship and flexibility in structuring the work of the committee. This is envisaged to be tackled under the legislative proposal for regulation on ECHA that is in preparation. The increase in number of SEAC opinion is moderate. The SEAC in its current set up should be able to absorb the additional tasks, after some adaptations in similar direction as for the RAC.\n\nAs regards the expertise, RAC has adequate expertise to address the majority of new tasks. The only exception is the extension of scope of assessments for waste stage under the batteries regulation, RoHS directive, directive on end-of-life vehicles and packaging and packaging waste directive, for which RAC will need to build or recruit additional expertise. The SEAC expertise might need to be extended to cover the waste stage of products and chemicals as well.\n\n| Table 16.

An additional 3 FTEs are necessary in the long term, topped up with 2 FTEs for short term, to deal with the new envisaged tasks under the Regulation on chemicals data (see Table 18). The first three years there will be a need of **5 FTEs (3 TA + 2 CA)** and operational budget of up to **EUR 766 000**. In the fourth year and beyond, there will be a need of **3 FTEs (3 TA)** per year and an operational budget of **EUR 400 000** per year. It should be noted that the allocation of 1 FTE out of those required by EEA is a reattribution of the existing resources used for operation of IPCHEM.\n\n| Table 17.

EEA is expected to host the chemical monitoring data in the environment of the POPs listed in Annex III, Part I and reported to ECHA under the POPs regulation. It is expected that this data stream will be very small or even zero. Member States are required to report those monitoring data only if they did not provide it to EEA under other reporting obligation. However, such data in air are already reported to EEA and the proposal for revision of water legislation\n\nproposed that such data in water will be reported to EEA as well. As the potential hosting of data will be close to zero, this work, if any, can be absorbed by EEA's existing resources.\n\nThe proposal for amendment of the EEA founding regulation via the regulation on (re-)attribution of tasks proposes to better specify existing tasks of EEA. EEA is given a mandate to develop assessment methodologies related to chemicals within the mission of the agency and EEA is required to actively cooperate with other EU Agencies as regards exchange of data and development of methodologies. There are no resource implications as part of this work as the provisions formalise the activities performed, they prescribe the procedural steps to follow and they enable the implementation of the legislative proposal on exchange of data. Any possible resource needs stemming from these provisions can be absorbed by the existing resources of EEA or the resources allocated for the common data platform.\n\nThe proposal for a regulation on chemicals data proposes to reattribute some of the existing tasks related to IPCHEM from the Commission to EEA and to expand it. Under this task, the EEA will be requested to collect and host human biomonitoring data and host all environmental occurrence data and indoor air quality data currently held in IPCHEM. Additional resources are needed for these tasks.\n\nThe proposal for the regulation on chemicals data will further attribute a new task to EEA related to the common data platform. EEA will be required to make the data it holds on chemicals available on a continuous basis to the common data platform in appropriate formats. Moreover, it will be required to set formats and controlled vocabularies in its area of competence so data can be easily shared, and it will be required to cooperate with ECHA and other agencies in developing and operating the common data platform. Additional resources are needed for these tasks.\n\nThe proposal will also attribute to EEA a new task on the early warning and action system and formalise the existing task on the indicator framework which is already carried out by EEA. EEA will be required to compile and collect annually the early warning signals into a report to be presented to the Commission, relevant agencies and Member State authorities to consider whether any regulatory action is needed. EEA together with ECHA will be required to continue operating and populating the indicator framework for chemicals policy. Additional resources are needed for these tasks.\n\nFinally, the proposal will require EEA to provide available data into the database on information on regulatory processes on chemicals, the repository of reference values and the database on environmental sustainability related data on chemicals and to cooperate with ECHA on the development of the databases and the repository. No additional resources are needed for these tasks. EEA currently does not hold any relevant data for those databases and the repository and the small contribution to the development of the tools is covered by the resources for the common data platform.\n\n#### *Impact on EEA's expertise*\n\nAs regards expertise, EEA has the necessary expertise, experience and the network to perform the allocated tasks.\n\n#### *Impact on EEA's network*\n\nNo significant impact on EEA's network. The network might however be required to assist in the collection of human biomonitoring data and early warning signals from activities of EEA member countries.\n\n#### **10.5 Overall impacts on EFSA**\n\n#### *Impact on EFSA's resources*\n\nThe proposals made by the Commission so far have not proposed additional resources for EFSA (see Table 19). EFSA was significantly reinforced in 2019 (by some 106 FTEs per year and operational budget of EUR 17 800 000 per year) as part of the Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 on the transparency and sustainability of the\n\nEU risk assessment in the food chain<sup>46</sup> and the tasks attributed were small, thus could be covered by the existing EFSA's resources. Additional **2 FTEs** are necessary in the long term, topped up with **3 FTEs** for short term, to deal with the envisaged tasks for EFSA under the proposal for regulation on chemicals data (see Table 20). In total, the first three years there will be a need of **5 FTEs (5 CA)** per year and operational budget of up to **EUR 670 000** per year. In the fourth year and beyond, there will be a need of **2 FTE (1 CA)** per year and operational budget of **EUR 500 000** per year.\n\n| Activity                                                        | 201FTEs |    |      |    |      |    |      |    | Operational costs |      |      |      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----|------|----|------|----|------|----|-------------------|------|------|------|\n|                                                                 | 2024    |    | 2025 |    | 2026 |    | 2027 |    | 2024              | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |\n|                                                                 | TA      | CA | TA   | CA | TA   | CA | TA   | CA |                   |      |      |      |\n| Regulation on serious cross-border threat to health             | 0       | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0                 | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals | 0       | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0                 | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n| SUM                                                             | 0       | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0    | 0  | 0                 | 0    | 0    | 0    |\n\n| Table 20.

EFSA on the request of the Commission is required to prepare a dossiers for harmonised classification of a substance. As hazard assessment is the core task of the Authority and the requests are unlikely to be too numerous, this work can be absorbed within the existing resources of the Authority.\n\nThe proposal for amendment of the general food law via the regulation on (re-)attribution of tasks proposes to better specify the existing tasks of EFSA. EFSA will be required to actively cooperate with other EU Agencies as regards exchange of data and development of methodologies. EFSA will be further required to engage more in preventing or solving a divergent opinion with other EU Agencies. There are no resource implications of these amendments. The provisions formalise the activities performed, they prescribe the procedural steps to follow and they enable the implementation of the legislative proposal on exchange of data. Any possible resource needs stemming from these provisions can be absorbed by the existing resources of EFSA.\n\nThe proposal for a regulation on chemicals data proposes to formalise existing tasks and to attribute new tasks to EFSA.\n\n• EFSA will be required to make data on chemicals it holds available on a continuous basis to the common data platform in appropriate formats. In addition, it will be required to set formats and controlled vocabularies in its area of competence so data can be easily shared, and it will be required\n\n<sup>46</sup> Regulation (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain and amending Regulations (EC) No 178/2002, (EC) No 1829/2003, (EC) No 2065/2003, (EC) No 1935/2004, (EC) No 1331/2008, (EC) No 1107/2009, (EU) 2015/2283) and Directive 2001/18/EC [\\(OJ L 231 6.9.2019, p.1\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R1381)\n\nto cooperate with ECHA and other agencies in developing and operating the common data platform. For this, EFSA will need 5 FTEs during 3 years to launch the common data platform with all its functionalities and data and then 2 FTEs from the 4th year and onwards to ensure adequate input, operation and the further development of the common data platform and its underlying services.\n\n- EFSA will also be required to contribute to the operation of and provide data to IPCHEM. This is an existing task of EFSA, so no additional resources are needed.\n- EFSA will furthermore be required to provide on a continuous basis information on the status of regulatory processes into the database with information on regulatory processes on chemicals.. EFSA already compiles such inform in the OpenEFSA database, which will be fed into the new database. There is no need for additional resources for this work as the compilation of information is ongoing and streamlining the information into the common data platform will be covered by the resources for the common data platform.\n- EFSA will further be required to provide relevant information to the repository of reference values and contribute to its development. EFSA already compiles reference values in its OpenFoodTox database, which will be fed into the repository of reference values. There is no need for additional resources for this activity as it already exists and streamlining it to the repository of reference values will be covered by the resources for the common data platform.\n- EFSA will be also required to provide available data into the database on environmental sustainability related data on chemicals. No additional resources are needed for this tasks, as EFSA currently does not hold any relevant data for this database and the potential small contribution to the development of the tools is covered by the resources for the common data platform.\n- EFSA will be required to cooperate with ECHA on the commissioning of scientific studies. EFSA already commissions such studies under General Food Law and the additional resource needs for the cooperation with ECHA in doing so should be absorbed by EFSA within the existing allocation of resources.\n- EFSA will be required to provide input to the indicators framework and early warning and action system. There is no need for additional resources for this activity, because EFSA already operates the emerging risk exchange network (EREN) for the food sector and the output of that work will be fed into the early warning and action system on chemicals.\n- Finally, EFSA will be required to ensure the compatibility of its system of study notifications established under Article 32b of the General Food Law with the database of study notifications to be set up by ECHA for remaining chemical legislation. The resources for this should be absorbed by the resources available in EFSA for the operation of its system of notification of studies.\n\n## *Impact on EFSA's expertise*\n\nAs regard expertise, EFSA has the necessary expertise and experience to perform the allocated tasks.\n\n## *Impact on EFSA's committees*\n\nNo significant impact on EFSA committees. The rapporteurs of EFSA committees that derive reference values might need to record the derived reference values and associated metadata into the repository of reference values or structure this information in the related opinion for automatic processing.\n\n## **10.6 Overall impacts on EMA**\n\n#### *Impact on EMA's resources*\n\nThe proposals for legislation on medicinal products for human use proposed a significant strengthening of EMA to deal with the new tasks proposed to be entrusted to EMA (see Table 21), with some of the tasks being relevant for the proposals on reattribution of tasks and on chemicals data. However, additional **2 FTEs** are necessary in the long term, topped up with **1 FTE** for short term, to deal with the envisaged tasks for EMA under the proposal for regulation on chemicals data (see Table 22). In total, the first three year there will be a need of **3 FTEs (3 CA)** per year and an operational budget of **EUR 100 000.** In the fourth year and beyond, there will be a need of **2 FTEs (2 CA)** per year and **EUR 0** per year.\n\n| Table 21.

It also requires EU-OSHA to provide relevant data to the information platform for chemical monitoring, database on regulatory processes on chemicals, repository of reference values, database of environmental sustainability related data on chemicals and to early warning and action system and framework of indicators. EU-OSHA, however, does not currently systematically collect or host any data relevant for the common data platform and its building blocks. EU-OSHA's role is therefore mainly to contribute with their inputs and suggestions to the development of the common data platform and its building blocks. EU-OSHA can be seen as a 'privileged' user of the system who can provide input to the development and operation to ensure that the systems are developed in such way that they suit also the needs of EU-OSHA. No additional resources are needed for these tasks, as they can be covered by the existing resources.\n\n#### *Impact on EU-OSHA's expertise*\n\nAs regards expertise, EU-OSHA has the necessary expertise and experience to perform the allocated tasks.\n\n#### *Impact on EU-OSHA's committees*\n\nThere is no impact on EU-OSHA's advisory groups or the management board.\n\n# **ANNEX I: MISSION, CORE ACTIVITIES, COMPETENCES AND SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF THE AGENCIES**\n\n# **1.

Concretely, the EU-OSHA:*\n\n- collects and analyses technical, scientific and economic information on safety and health at work in the Member States in order to:\n  - o identify risks and good practices as well as existing national priorities and programmes;\n  - o provide the necessary input to Union priorities and programmes; and\n  - o disseminate that information to the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the social partners and other actors involved in the field of safety and health at work;\n- collects and analyses technical, scientific and economic information on research into safety and health at work and on other research activities which involve aspects connected with safety and health at work and disseminate the results of the research and research activities;\n- promotes and supports cooperation and exchange of information and experience amongst the Member States in the field of safety and health at work, including information on training programmes;\n- organises conferences and seminars and exchanges of expertise from the Member States in the field of safety and health at work;\n- supplies the Union institutions and bodies and the Member States with the objective technical, scientific and economic information available and the qualified expertise they require to formulate and implement judicious and effective policies designed to protect the safety and health of workers;\n- provides forums for exchange of experiences and information between the governments, the social partners and other stakeholders at national level;\n- contributes, including through evidence-based information and analyses, to the implementation of reforms and policies at national level;\n- collects and makes available information on safety and health matters from and to third countries and international organisations;\n- provides technical, scientific and economic information on methods and tools for implementing preventive activities, identify good practices and promote preventive actions, paying particular attention to the specific problems of MSMEs and, with regard to good practices, focuses, in particular, on practices which constitute practical tools to be used in drawing up an assessment of the risks to safety and health at work, and identifying the measures to be taken to tackle those risks;\n- contributes to the development of Union strategies and action programmes relating to the protection of safety and health at work,\n- establishes a strategy for relations with third countries and international organisations;\n\n• carries out awareness raising and communication activities and campaigns on safety and health at work issues.\n\nEU-OSHA's specific competences include:\n\n- Competence in occupational safety and health as regards the workplace management of dangerous substances (this includes registered chemicals and process-generated substances and mixtures (e.g. silica dust, welding fumes, diesel motor emissions or wood dust))\n- Development of tools for the management of dangerous substances at the workplace level and sectoral workplace risk assessment tools (OiRA)\n- Collecting information on national tools and guidance and examples of good practice regarding the management of dangerous substances at work.\n- Development of information and awareness-raising campaigns in the area of dangerous substances at work\n- Collecting and analysing technical and scientific information in the area of dangerous substances at work and related health problems and publishing the results\n- Development of surveys targeting exposures at workplaces, e.g. the Workers´ exposure survey on cancer risk factors in Europe\n- Supporting the European Commission, for instance through the development of guidance in the area of dangerous substances management and OSH\n\nThe EU-OSHA maintains a network that comprises the main components of the national information networks, including the national employers' and employees' organisations and the national focal points.\n\n- Network of national **Focal Points and Member State tripartite networks**: in accordance with the founding regulation of EU-OSHA, the national authorities or a national institution designated by the Member State as a national focal point coordinates and transmits the information to be supplied at national level to EU-OSHA within the framework of an agreement between each focal point and EU-OSHA on the basis of the work programme adopted by EU-OSHA. The national authorities or national institution shall consult the national employers' and employees' organisations and shall take into account their point of view in accordance with national law or practice. The Member States regularly inform EU OSHA of the main components of their national safety and health at work systems and strategies. This network provides input to EU-OSHA's work and the mechanism to disseminate products and information to national stakeholders. In addition, the focal points are active in the planning and implementation of EU-OSHA campaigns as well as nominating national experts to the Agency's groups and seminars.\n- Close functional links with the **Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work** and its working parties and the **Senior Labour Inspectors Committee** and its working groups\n\n# **ANNEX II: SUMMARY OF THE FEEDBACK RECEIVED THROUGH THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE CALL FOR EVIDENCE FOR THE INITIATIVE ON (RE-)ATTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL WORK ON CHEMICALS TO THE EU AGENCIES**\n\nThe call for evidence was published on the Commission's website ['Have your say'](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13161-Chemicals-making-best-use-of-EU-agencies-to-streamline-scientific-assessments_en) on 15 March 2022 and the feedback period lasted 30 days, until 12 April 2022.\n\n## **1. RESPONDENTS**\n\nIn total, 65 submissions were received (61 unique submissions and 4 replicative submissions by the same respondent), majority being from business associations and companies (in total around 70% of submissions), followed by submissions from EU citizens (11%), non-governmental organisations (6%), public authorities (6%), others (5 %) and academic/research institutions (1.5%).\n\n## Proportions of number of feedbacks received by category of respondents\n\nImage /page/52/Figure/5 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of different categories. The categories and their corresponding percentages are as follows: Business association: 32 (49.23%), Company/business organisation: 14 (21.54%), EU citizen: 7 (10.77%), Public authority: 4 (6.15%), Non-governmental organisation (NGO): 4 (6.15%), Other: 3 (4.62%), and Academic/research Institution: 1 (1.54%).\n\nAs regards geographical variation, the majority of feedback was received from respondents from Belgium (49%), followed by Germany (17%), Poland (8%), France (6%), Spain and Denmark (3% each) and UK, Sweden, Slovakia, Portugal, Norway, Japan, Italy, Finland and Austria (2% each).\n\n## **2. TYPE OF RESPONSES**\n\nLarge majority of responses were relevant to the topic of the call for evidence. Only 3 responses were assessed as not relevant to the 1S1A. They provided specific comments on the ongoing revisions of some pieces of legislation but without relevance to the 1S1A or just a general critisism of the EU legal framework.\n\nAs this has been the first public consultation on an initiative under the 1S1A, a lot of feedback received was not specific about the consulted initiative on the reattribution of task to the EU Agencies but about the general scope of the 1S1A approach as well as other initiatives announced under the 1S1A. All feedback received is however useful for the upcoming discussions, therefore, the text below summarises all relevant input received.\n\n## **3. SUPPORT TO THE INITIATIVE ON 1S1A**\n\nGenerally, there is a large support of the initiative among the respondents, whether of the 1S1A approach as a whole or of the specific initiative on the reattribution of tasks. 67% of respondents expressed their explicit support, 23% did not expressed explicitely their opinion but provided relevant advices on how to develop the 1S1A approach and about 10% expressed doubts about usefulness of the initiative or opposition to the initiative.\n\nThe well-implemented 1S1A initiative is seen by respondents as beneficial for both industry and regulators. The respondents supporting the initiative identified the following benefits of the initiative:\n\n- More uniform risk assessment across relevant chemical legislation; enhanced consistency of assessments and their outcomes, carried out on the same dataset;\n- Improved robustness of the assessments;\n- Involvement of the right expertise at the right place at the right time;\n- Provision of tailored assessments under specific legislations/uses if relevant;\n- Optimal use of resources;\n- Increased efficiency and predictability;\n- Making use of synergies (phys/chem/tox data available at different EU agencies);\n- Elimination of duplication of animal testing in the EU and a driver for both improved sustainability and better protection of animals;\n- Strengthening trust between society and industry, whilst improving efficiency, and sound science-based regulatory and political decision-making; achieving a robust and consistent approach to chemical regulation;\n\nSome respondent identified concrete past and on-going discrepancies and ineficiencies as regards the safety assessment of chemicals that they hope to be avoided by the implementation of the 1S1A initiative. These are:\n\n- Past discrepancy in assessments of phthalates and bisphenols between ECHA and EFSA and between REACH and Food Contact Materials;\n- On-going discrepancy in risk management measures on silicon dioxide under the biocidal product regulation (where there is a low limit on its presence in biocidal products) and REACH (where this substance is exempted from information requirements and can be sold in products at much higher concentrations than in the biocidal products);\n- Currently no link exists between the REACH and Food Contact Material legal framework as regards the re-use of data, although the same substances are being regulated under both frameworks. On the chemical side, over ten years of REACH implementation led to the generation of a very comprehensive (eco)toxicological dataset on a wide number of substances, which is available to ECHA. It would be very efficient and avoid unnecessary test and the repetition of studies, especially in vivo (animal studies), if this data could be used for the risk assessment in the FCM framework by EFSA. Although the robust study summaries provide some publicly available data, like toxicological end points, this is often not accepted by authorities as the original studies behind the end points are requested, which cannot be accessed by the authorities. Therefore, the link needs to be established between these two legislation and the legal framework around the usage of such data should be modified and broadened to facilitate the reuse of already available data and to allow other Agencies to access the REACH data.\n- There is a need for an improved vertical coordination and collaboration between the expert panels of EFSA evaluating the same substance. Challenges have previously been seen for e.g. fluoride, evaluated by the EFSA nutrition panel but where the contaminants panel is also relevant. For chemical substances like fluoride it is important that an evaluation covers both aspects of nutrition and toxicology. For some contaminants we have also seen that JECFA and EFSA have evaluated the same substance with different output/result. It would improve the use of resources if it were not necessary to have two different bodies evaluating the same substance. However, as Codex Alimentarius refer to JECFA evaluations and EU Commission to EFSA evaluations it will be challenging to accept/adopt the evaluation made by the other Committee.\n- Currently, there is no central searchable database on environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals available. Therefore, it is proposed to integrate the validated environmental information on pharmaceuticals held by EMA in data platforms already used on a European level. The central database would also be a valuable tool for endpoints of monograph systems for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe respondents opposing or doubting the initiative provided the following arguments:\n\n- Did not observe problems with 'duplication' or 'inconsistent outcomes', although the substances they produce/use fall within various regulatory domains;\n- The initiative is likely to create more complexity, as well as a transition period which will considerably affect substance evaluation and authorization processes and timelines, as well as the burden placed on applicants. The latter will come on top of the increased complexity created by the recent implementation of the Transparency Regulation and its requirements related to confidentiality justification and the new IT tools to be used for notification and submission of dossiers to EFSA and the Commission.\n- Several product specific regulations require special product qualities like e.g. a high purity and consider very specific exposure possibilities. The general goal of true \"one substance, one assessment\" is highly difficult to implement, taking into account all possible applications and the various grades of a substance on the market. The assessment of a substance requires a high level of expertise and detailed considerations.\n- It is important that chemicals used in the EU are assessed by several independent research teams, which will reduce the risk of lobbying and increase the possibility of comparing test results.\n\nSome confusions or misunderstandings could be observed in some of the responses provided. The most common ones are:\n\n- Some respondents considers that ECHA does only hazard assessment while EFSA does risk assessment. The true is that both agencies do both, hazard and risk assessment. The confusion might originates from the fact that ECHA does also harmonised classification of hazards under the CLP regulation, which is pure hazard assessment, and respondents are not aware of their risk assessment work as part of the REACH restriction process or implementation of the biocidal product regulation, POPs regulation or drinking water directive.\n- Some respondents fear that moving some assessments to ECHA will automatically result in hazard-based regulation, omitting the use of exposure information. The true is that reattribution of tasks on safety assessment will not change the risk management measures. In addition, as explained above, ECHA is also doing risk assessments and has experience in doing so.\n- Some respondents fear of the ambition to create one new 'risk assessment' agency and consolidating all risk assessments into such agency. There is no such intention. The objective of 1S1A initiative is to improve cooperation between agencies and clearly distribute the relevant tasks among them with the objective to improve coherence, efficiency and effectiveness of safety assessments.\n\n### **4. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF 1S1A**\n\nNumber of respondents provided their views and expectations regarding the scope and objectives of 1S1A.\n\nThe expectations and views expressed by the respondents regarding the general scope and objective of the 1S1A are as follows:\n\n- 1S1A should ensure that the level of protection for the human health and the environment is not jeopardised and remains high.\n- 1S1A should work towards a coherent protection goals by developping a new EU Human Health Directive that aims to achieve 'good public health', protecting humans from the combined action of chemicals and combined action of chemicals and non-chemical environmental stressors.\n- 1S1A should be limited to one substance, one hazard assessment. The hazard assessment the basic evaluation of substance properties *–* should be grounded in a single set of agreed scientific principles, as it is independent of the area of application or legislation. Risk assessments and potential socio-economic assessment however should remain tailored to their different purposes and legislation, taking into account the use of, the exposure to the substance and particularities of the sector. Risk management measures should be also specific and tailor-made.\n- 1S1A should ensure that for a specific use there is only one risk assessment performed across legislation valuing existing expertise.\n- 1S1A should ensure that all relevant assessments are updated if new data and new assessment lead to a new TDI or PNEC value to ensure that all regulations rely on limit values derived from the latest knowledge. It\n\nshould be considered in the new omnibus regulation to require updates in all sector specific regulations within a given timeframe when a new TDI or PNEC value is derived by an EU scientific committee.\n\n- The actions of 1S1A initiative should be focused on where duplication really appears, i.e. to\n  - o hazard assessment and classification, identification of acute concentration limits ATEs, local effects specific concentration limits SCLs and NOAELs/LOAELs for human health, ECxx/LCxx/NOECs for acute aquatic toxicity and other wildlife. Based on these endpoints, the derivation of DNEL/OEL/TDI/ADI/PNECs/EQs, etc. may differ between legislations (REACH, OSH, PPR, BPR, FCM, WFD) due to different methodologies to carry out their safety assessment.\n  - o substances used in different applications covered by different legislation.\n- Although 1S1A is targeting on 'chemicals', it should be expanded also to microbials, natural substances and semiochemicals used as biocontrol. Biocontrol products themselves may be used for more than one purpose; for example, micro-organisms are used in the area of crop protection, but also as fertiliser or biostimulant under Fertilizer Product Regulation. The same micro-organism are used in agriculture and are subject to different regulatory frameworks and thus to different sets of data requirements and procedures. Ultimately this may lead to different and even contrary decisions, based on the same data package the same micro-organism may be authorised for one area of use (e.g. as a biostimulant), but may not be approved for another area of use (e.g. crop protection). Establishing within the EU a group of biocontrol experts is recommended. To start, the group should consist of microbial experts from Member States, EFSA, ECHA, and other relevant EU institutions that, in close cooperation with COM, will be responsible for all evaluations and assessments of microbial active substances submitted in the EU for approval. This would guarantee a consistent and scientifically sound approach that would considerably simplify and speed up procedures. This should then be extended to cover experts in natural substances and semiochemicals.\n- 1S1A should also aim to improve comparability of monitoring data across Member States in the area of food contaminants. Pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, Member States are requested to examine samples and provide necessary data that could lead to a comprehensive risk assessment. Despite the European scope of the risk assessment, means to support such data collection is still largely maintained at a Member State level, manpower and the financial means of Member States for this varies, which all together may lead to national authorities providing data with high variability. This initiative on streamlining scientific assessments is an opportunity for the Commission to support the integral role that national authorities and European Reference Laboratories do to ensure the conclusions taken from these studies and guidance documents are as robust as possible.\n- Some respondents argued that veterinary medicinal product should be exlcuded from the scope of 1S1A, while others were arguing for importnace to include also medicinal products, in particular as regards the environmental data on medicinal and veterinary products.\n\nThe expectations and views expressed regarding the five specific areas of the 1S1A initiative identified in the chemicals strategy for sustainability are as follows:\n\n#### *Coordination and initiation of the assessments*\n\n- Upfront close coordination of assessments should be established across different DG's, Scientific committees (including Scientific Panels), Agencies as well as Member States at European level, to decide what is required, and who does what and when;\n- A central coordination mechanism should be established, including a coordinated problem formulation phase (i.e. identifying the correct scientific question that needs to be answered) which would enhance predictability for industry;\n- Mechanisms needs to be created to integrate assessments that specify the health and environmental endpoints used by the different agencies;\n- Different bodies active in the assessment of chemicals must ensure proper coordination of their work, especially when they are assessing the same substance. This includes an exchange of information such as results of previous assessments.\n- Also the national authorities of each EU member state that should be active in the assessment of chemicals, e.g. under REACH, are included in the \"one substance, one assessment\" initiative in order to prevent diverging views between member states and/or EU authorities regarding the assessment of (groups of) chemicals.\n\n- It is vital that the implementation of the \"one substance, one assessment\" approach contains provisions for supporting greater interagency cooperation;\n- To make this system work it is recommended that evaluators/risk assessors from different regulatory bodies attend each other meetings thus ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication of work;\n- Cooperation between EU and national agencies is crucial for a better usage of resources.\n- It shall be avoided that overlapping evaluations and assessments are taking place in parallel within the same regulatory context. Risk management measure processes should not be started during an on-going substance evaluation, where data gaps may be identified and therefore pre-empting the step in the substance evaluations that identifies the most appropriate risk management measures to be identified or data to be gathered to be available;\n\n#### *Allocation of responsibilities*\n\n- Tasks should be reattributed amongst the agencies to ensure efficiency, by assigning the relevant responsibilities to the pertinent agency rather than reshuffling already established responsibilities;\n- Each body (i.e. authority, agency, working group, etc.) that is carrying out an assessment of (groups of) chemicals should be equipped with sufficient expertise necessary for the specific assessment, e.g. in the field of toxicology, ecotoxicology, occupational safety and health, exposure assessment, etc\n- Cooperation between EU and national authorities should be also optimized. Synergies and overlaps must be clearly identified. This area is not left out and there is a clear division of tasks.\n\n#### *Data*\n\n- Data exchange across Committees and Agencies should be ensured to avoid duplication of data submission; a common information base needs to be created to avoid duplication of assessments, for example with an open data platform on chemicals and tools for accessing relevant academic data;\n- Exposure assessment tools and methodology could also be centralised on a common data platform;\n- Access to all available data in the same structured format should be provided for all EU authorities. Equal transparency regimes are applied across all sectors.\n- Academic data has a role to play in science-based policy making, however, there needs to be a process to ensure that data is reliable and robust. There are 1000's of studies related to titanium dioxide that are published each year and the titanium dioxide industry has a comprehensive screening process in place including regular updates of the REACH dossier. A lot of the academic data related to titanium dioxide is not reliable or robust enough with basic information such as the identity of the substance unknown. The other concern is the inherent bias as non-adverse outcome are less likely to be published. The OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals were developed for this reason, and it is important that they remain the key benchmark.\n- We strongly support the proposal to introduce new tools for the 1S1A approach, which would further improve the work of the industry and scientific committees in ensuring consumer safety by:\n  - o extending the use of the public activities coordination tool to other legislation\n  - o establishing an EU repository of human and environmental health-based limit values; and\n  - o establishing a common, open data platform on chemicals and tools for accessing relevant academic data\n- We support the principle of harmonizing the format in which data is reported to enable data to be shared between agencies. A harmonized data format will in our opinion lead to efficiencies and greater transparency. To us a harmonized data format does not equal harmonized data requirements between agencies since adequate data required for a risk assessment depends on the sector considered. It would be important to have a systematic mechanism supported by the authorities to organize the request of data to the manufactures to avoid duplication of efforts/resources and to guarantee a good agreement among the interested parties. The format of all data collected should be developed in close collaboration with the industry to ensure it is fit for purpose.\n- We are in favour of promoting the environmental biomonitoring and check how the establishment of that limit values could benefit from this biomonitoring.\n\n- The legal framework around the usage of REACH registration data should be modified and broadened to allow other Agencies to access such information, in order to prevent double work, but above all the repetition of studies, especially in-vivo, for the same substances. With specific reference to evaluations concerning food contact materials, we believe that EFSA would greatly benefit from access to registration dossier data, with due consideration of data protection. Similarly, we believe that also MSCA should also have access to the existing data. For instance with regards to FCM evaluations, this would enable them to make evaluation on the same dataset used by EFSA, uniformizing the petitioning process by avoiding divergence in the approach.\n- Environmental safety data already assessed by one of the European agencies should be available for procedures under different EU regulations. This should also apply to environmental data from the veterinary and human pharmaceutical legislation. Therefore, including EMA as agency responsible for the environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals is highly welcome. Currently, there is no central searchable database on environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals available. Therefore, it is proposed to integrate the validated environmental information on pharmaceuticals in data platforms already used on a European level. The central database would also be a valuable tool for endpoints of monograph systems for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals.\n\n#### *Methodologies*\n\n- Clear, standardised approaches/protocols on hazard and risk assessments must be developed to ensure consistency and predictability, while acknowledging the different needs of the different regulatory frameworks. For example, in food safety related matters it is crucial to define health-based guidance values from the context of food exposure only, and therefore the ways of assessing the hazard might divert from other legislative areas where other routes of exposure are more prominent.\n- The assessment of chemicals must be science-based.\n- Harmonisation of the methodologies for the assessment of chemicals should incorporate and expand the use of non-animal New Approach Methods and next generation risk assessment tools (based on the knolwdge acquired by SCCS), making this a default 'one assessment' framework applicable to all chemicals.\n- Harmonisation of evaluation methodologies is needed. For example, the AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level), DNEL (derived no-effect level), the MOS (margin of safety) and the OEL (occupational exposure limit) are four different ways to set a threshold limit under Pesticides, REACH, the Cosmetics Regulation and workplace regulation, respectively. Another example is the methodology used under the Water Framework Directive to set environmental quality criteria with the purpose of protecting humans from consumption of polluted fish and shellfish. This methodology differs from the methodology used by EFSA and national food safety authorities to set limit values for edible fish, thereby resulting in different limit values for the same substance.\n\n#### *Transparency rules*\n\n- Transparency on the decisions and processes is increased;\n- All information regarding the evaluating authority, the process and status of the assessment as well as all relevant documentation should be available to all stakeholders.\n- Transparency rules should be also harmonized.\n\n#### **5. REATTRIBUTION OF TASKS TO EU AGENCIES**\n\nNumber of respondents provided their views on how the reattribution of tasks to the EU agencies should be done. These are:\n\n- Reattribution of work must not result in a single agency being responsible for the risk evaluations of all chemicals. A clear demarcation of responsibilities between relevant EU agencies and regulations is needed.\n- The role, tasks and expertise of each agency should be clearly defined and exploited in a targeted manner. Agencies should stay within their assigned areas of duty and abstain from political interventions.\n\n#### *Expertise*\n\n- It is strongly suggested that expertise for risk assessment under the different regulations should stay with the existing responsible agencies. Each Agency is best positioned to lead and provide specific assessments due to their extensive experience in product specific related matters, e.g., EFSA for food use, EMA for medicines use.\n- It shall be ensured that whatever body carries out the risk evaluation tasks it shall have available the necessary and adequate expertise within the application domain of the use of the chemicals.\n- We strongly encourage the Commission to review the functioning of the existing scientific committees, agencies, consultants, etc. supporting scientific assessments to ensure that they have the relevant expertise (both quantitatively and qualitatively) and always strive for opinions of the highest scientific excellence and integrity\n- Not all hazard endpoints are covered by all regulations. For the environment, the Plant Protection Regulation is probably the most advanced as requiring testing on species not covered by other regulations such as honeybees, earthworms, plants, beneficial arthropods, birds. Therefore, the derivation of these endpoints should stay with the Agency having the expertise, *i.e.* EFSA.\n- The reattribution should ensure that valuable expertise gathered by existing entities is preserved. The knowledge of SCCS to perform risk assessment without animal use has to be preserved and cosmetics have to continue use only data from non-animal tests. Transparent safety assessment process for cosmetics should continue to be underpinned by the use and further development of the current Notes of Guidance from SCCS.\n\n#### *Resources*\n\n- The necessary resources must accompany new tasks to the agencies.\n- Re-attribution of work should not lead to the situation that the Agency or committee is not able to handle the workload and hence would jeopardise the quality of the work or result in the use of scientifically unsound decisions/approaches.\n\n#### *Organisation of scientific committees*\n\n- Agencies might need to be reorganised to deal with increased workload. RAC in ECHA has already now immense workload; In ECHA, MSC could be turned into the hazard assessment committee to deal with CLP classification, RAC could focus only on risk assessments. It would be useful to also align panels in EFSA as the same substance is evaluated by two panels.\n- Instead of creating new scientific panels, the agencies should be supported to be able to reinforce the expert independent committees and working groups that already exist, with a certain level of flexibility and openness in terms of reaching the best assessment.\n- The safety assessment for consumer products should be performed by an independent commitee which has equal status to hazard assessment committee (i.e. a safety assessment committee for consumer product should not report into a hazard assessment committee).\n\n#### *Tasks to re-attribute*\n\n- For substances used in food contact materials the process should involve EFSA and ECHA. The process should start with the hazard identification and characterization of substances, followed by an FCM specific risk assessment. We recommend ECHA play a central role in the hazard assessment of chemicals, while EFSA assess risks linked to their use in FCMs (which are highly specific compared to those for other uses of chemicals).\n- So far, a number of tasks have been distributed to ECHA, or are foreseen to be distributed to ECHA. This includes e.g. opinions on health based limit values under OSH, derivation of limit values under the Drinking Water Directive, evaluation of cosmetic ingredients under the Cosmetic Products Regulation, etc. However, other areas have not been addressed such as e.g. derivation of environmental quality standards under the Water Framework Directive, or opinions on chemical substances in e.g. toys by the scientific committee SCHEER. It should be considered how to achieve harmonization in these areas as well, including if tasks should be redistributed to one of the agencies (EFSA or ECHA)\n- The proposal should include as many substance regulations as possible within the EU legislative framework, e.g. Toys directive, food and feed additives, environmental quality standards (EQS).\n\n#### *Impact assessment*\n\n- Few respondents suggested to perform an impact assessment for the 1S1A initiative to make sure that potential impacts on business operators are adequately considered and to make sure that businesses are involved in the development of the initiative.\n\n# **ANNEX III: DETAILED IMPACT ANALYSIS OF THE (RE-)ATTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL WORK RELATED TO CHEMICALS TO EU AGENCIES**\n\n## **1. DRINKING WATER DIRECTIVE [\\(2020/2184\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2020/2184/oj)**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: N/A, no current process exists at EU level\n\n#### (Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Revision of drinking water directive\n\n#### **Type of task:** New\n\n**Brief task overview:** Establishing and maintaining four EU positive lists for substances and compositions authorised to be used for the manufacture of materials in contact with water intended for human consumption.\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\nCurrent process:\n\nN/A, no process exists at EU level\n\nNew process:\n\n### *1. From national lists to the first EU positive lists (review programme)*\n\nThe Commission, supported by ECHA, compiles the first EU positive lists for substances and compositions used in the manufacture of organic, cementitious, metallic and inorganic materials in contact with water intended for human consumption. These first positive lists are based on national positive lists notified to ECHA by July 2021; in addition, the positive list for organic materials will incorporate the plastic FCM positive list of Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011. All entries in the EU positive lists will be subject to a review. To this end, each entry will be accompanied by an expiry date by which industry needs to submit an (review) application to ECHA. The burden of proof is with industry: if industry wishes to keep a substance or composition on the EU positive list, they need to submit an application by a specified deadline. If no application is received by the deadline, the substance or composition is removed from the positive list.\n\nIt is estimated that the first EU positive lists will contain approximately 2000 entries with assigned expiry dates of 2028, 2031, 2034 and 2037 depending on the hazard of each entry and the availability of past risk assessments. The first European positive list will be adopted by January 2024, the first review applications can be submitted as from January 2026 and the whole review programme shall be finished within 15 years by end December 2039.\n\n### *2. Updating the EU positive list*\n\nOnce established, ECHA will need to manage the EU positive lists through the addition, removal and updating of entries in the lists. The process can be triggered by:\n\na. An economic operator who wishes to add a substance or composition to an EU positive list or has to submit a review application for an existing entry;\n\n- b. An authority that has a reason to propose removing a substance or composition from an EU positive list or to update an entry;\n- c. ECHA, that may submit an application on the Commission's request.\n\nOnce an application is received, the process at ECHA contains the following main steps:\n\n- Automated and manual checks of the application to verify completeness and accordance with the information requirements which will be set out in implementing legislation;\n- Dissemination of information and consultation of interested parties;\n- Opinion development via the RAC committee;\n- Support to applicants and Member State Competent Authorities;\n- Technical and scientific support to the Commission.\n\nThe first review applications can be submitted as from January 2026.\n\n# **Proximity to ECHA mandate:**\n\nThe work is close to the ECHA core mandate of assessing the risk of chemical substances based on industry applications and many of the core competences are already present in the Agency.\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already supports similar work on substance risk<br>assessment under REACH and other legislation.

The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on existing expert competencies which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks, as well as new competencies which ECHA should acquire (e.g. migration assessment and materials science)\n\n### **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nN/A, no current process exists at EU level\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nThe Directive is in force since 2021. Industry can notify their intention to submit an application from January 2025 with the first industry applications expected from January 2026 onwards.\n\nA total of 3 new full-time equivalent temporary agent staff (AD 5-7) (average cost EUR 136 000/year, during 4 years) and 2 full-time equivalent contract agent staff (CA FG III, average cost EUR 65 000/year), have been allocated to ECHA to set up the system. After 4 years, the review process will necessitate additional resources, i.e. 10 FTE on average for the next 4 years (7 temporary agent staff and 3 contract agent staff). A new assessment of the needs will be completed at the end of the period on the basis of the experience gained during the first years of functioning of the system. According to first estimates, additional staff (around 3 FTE, i.e. bringing the total to 13 FTEs) might be needed to complete the review of all substances on the positive lists in a reasonable deadline (15 years).\n\nIn addition to staff costs, EUR 1 000 000 is reserved for the first 3 years annually to set up the IT systems, whereas roughly half of this amount will be needed for maintenance work after the set-up period. Infrastructure expenditure has been estimated at 24% of the staff expenditure.\n\nThe aforementioned resources have been estimated using a calculation model which takes account of relevant experience from tasks executed by ECHA under other regulatory frameworks (e.g. REACH, CLP, BPR) and from the implementation of the existing national approaches where relevant. It sets out the resources that will be needed by ECHA over a time window of 20 years, including a review programme running over 15 years, in order to handle the foreseen tasks.\n\nThe estimated resources for the process to review and update the EU positive lists are application/dossier driven. The number of applications/dossiers have been estimated on the basis of substances on lists currently in use by the Member States and that have been registered under REACH. Member States' forecasts were used to estimate the flux of incoming applications/dossiers. The key tasks involve examination of the applications/dossiers, opinion development and decision process. The estimated resources for the initial setup, ICT process infrastructure and development of methodologies, for the process from national lists to the first EU positive lists as well as the resources involved in other tasks such as helpdesk, legal support are task driven regardless of the number of dossiers.\n\nOnce the routine phase for dealing with the tasks under the proposed recast of the Directive has been approached (from the tenth year onwards), about 70 % of the resources will be involved in the operational work (dossier and opinion related efforts).\n\nAdditional limited resources might be necessary for EFSA in case the existing system of FCM (under evaluation) is still in place when the review will start (after 2025) to ensure coordination on the review of the plastic lists. These potential additional resources are not included in the present estimate.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                    | Resource needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | - Establishing and maintaining four EU positive lists for substances and compositions authorized to be used for the manufacturing of materials in contact with water intended for human consumption | Financial resource needs:<br>2021: EUR 1 000 000<br>2022: EUR 1 000 000<br>2023: EUR 1 000 000<br>2024: EUR 510 000<br>2025: EUR 520 000<br>2026: EUR 530 000<br>2027: EUR 540 000<br>Human resource needs:<br>2021: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2022: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2023: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2024: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2025: 6 TA, 3 CA<br>2026: 7 TA, 3 CA<br>2027: 8 TA, 3 CA |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the drinking water directive regulation:\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: Yes - for authorisations, No - for others\n\n## **2. REGULATION ON SERIOUS CROSS-BORDER THREATS TO HEALTH [\\(2022/2371\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2371)**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of the SCHEER Committee\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** proposal for regulation on serious cross-border threats to health.\n\n## **Type of task:** existing\n\n**Brief task overview:** ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA, ECDC, EMCDDA are tasked, on the request of the Commission, to carry out \"a risk assessment of the potential severity of the threat to public health, including possible public health measures\" when there is an alert of a cross-border threat of chemical origin (see draft article 20.1(c)).\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nDecision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross border threats to health (the Decision) layed down rules on combating serious cross border threats to health. Where there is an incident or alert of an actual or potential serious cross-border threat to health that fulfils the criteria detailed in Article 9 of the Decision (Box 1), the Commission shall, where necessary for the coordination of the response at Union level and upon request of the Health Security Committee (HSC) or on its own initiative, make promptly available to the national competent authorities and to the HSC, through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS), a public health risk assessment of the potential severity of the threat to public health, including possible public health measures.\n\nIn operational terms, the Commission and the HSC may request the SCHEER to undertake rapid risk assessments (within 72h) in case of chemical cross border public health threats from both manmade and naturally occurring events (e.g. chemicals released during an incident or during a volcanic eruption) that may have an impact on health (hereafter chemical health threats). The assessment did not cover the wider effects on the environment which are outside the scope of addressing the effects on human health (e.g. biological effects on ecosystems) as these were outside of the remit of the Decision and would therefore have to be taken forward through other existing mechanisms, e.g. through a separate mandate or different body.\n\nTo implement this obligation, SCHEER has developed a guidance in ad hoc rapid risk assessment of serious cross-border chemical health threats. SCHEER set up and maintained a continuous readiness to provide rapid risk assessments (within 72h) where urgently needed by setting up a SCHEER permanent working group on rapid risk assessment. The committee held on average 10 meetings per year and performed regular crisis exercises.\n\n### Changes in the process:\n\nThe responsibility for rapid risk assessment for risks of a cross-border threat that is linked to medicinal products and medical devices is assigned to EMA, for risks of a cross-border threat of chemical origin is shared between ECHA and EFSA based on their mandate and for risk of a cross border threat of threats of environmental origin, including those due to the climate, are shared among ECHA, EFSA and EEA based on their mandate.\n\n**Proximity to Agencies (ECHA, EEA, EFSA and EMA) mandate:** EFSA has been already involved in the rapid risk assessment based on the old system, in parallel with SCHEER, and thus have developed expertise and procedures. For ECHA and EMA this is a new task. While they have certain expertise in the area of chemical or environmental risks, they do not have dedicated expertise related to risk management of chemical incidents, nor do they hold data on emissions into the environment. For EEA is a new task too but EEA holds data on emissions into the environment and there are some synergies with (re-)attribution of SEVESO III work on chemical accidents.\n\n# **Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:**\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | Medium    | Process and expertise:<br>ECHA, EFSA and EMA already provides scientific advice on chemical<br>substances under their mandate.

With this level of activity this work is estimated to take up at least 20% of the work time of the DG SANTE SCHEER secretariat (= ca. 0.6 FTE/year) and require significant time from the SCHEER members. In addition, the operational budget for the reimbursement of members is at least EUR 48 000 (20% of EUR 240 000/year)\n\n| DG SANTE (Health Security unit) |                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DG SANTE (SCHEER secretariat)   | Ca. 0.6 FTE (ca. 20% of SCHEER capacity)<br>EUR 48 000 operational SCHEER budget (at<br>peak EUR 68 000) |\n| Total                           | Ca. 0.6 FTE                                                                                              |\n\nCurrent budget line: DG SANTE\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nThe work performed by SCHEER will be shared among several agencies based on their expertise and mandate. The requests for rapid risk assessments are made on ad hoc basis and are not very frequent.

EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS FROM CHEMICALS (PARC)**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: N/A, no current process exists at EU level\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EEA, EFSA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** None, voluntary (ECHA and EFSA) or grant (EEA) agreement to participate in the project\n\n### **Type of task:** new\n\n**Brief task overview:** Participate in and provide input and support to the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\nPARC is one of the projects selected for funding by the European Union's \"Horizon Europe\" framework programme for the 2021-2027 period. It is a 7-year partnership that started on 1st May 2022 and that consists of 200 partners in 28 countries and at EU level, national agencies and research organisations working in the areas of the environment or public health, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA).\n\nPARC aims to advance research, share knowledge and improve skills in chemical risk assessment. By doing so, it will help support [the European Union's Chemicals Strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/chemicals-strategy_en) for Sustainability, paving the way for the \"zero pollution\" ambition announced in the [European Green Deal.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/communication-european-green-deal_en)\n\nPARC represents a campaign of unprecedented scale, since it brings together about 200 European players, involving national and European health and safety agencies as well as research organisations. The partnership encompasses all aspects of chemical risk assessment, aiming in particular to: better anticipate emerging risks, better account for combined risks, and underpin the concrete implementation of new orientations in European public policies to safeguard health and the environment in response to important issues for health, the ecology and citizens' expectations.\n\nThe partnership builds on work undertaken as part of the European Joint Programme on human biomonitoring, [HBM4EU \\(Human Biomonitoring for Europe\\)](https://www.hbm4eu.eu/), which came to an end in the summer of 2022, and broadens the scope of its interests specifically to the assessment of environmental risks.\n\nMain objectives of the PARC are:\n\n- Develop the scientific skills needed to address current and future challenges in chemical safety\n- Provide new data, methods and innovative tools to those responsible for assessing and managing the risks of chemical exposure\n- Strengthen the networks which bring together actors specialised in the different scientific fields contributing to risk assessment\n\nThe EU Agencies (ECHA, EFSA and EEA) are to contribute to, participate in and support various workpackages of PARC.\n\n**Proximity to mandate:** The task is close to EEA, EFSA and ECHA mandate and key competences regarding risk assessment of chemicals, management and interpretation of data related to chemicals.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:** PARC consortium will benefit greatly from invlovement of EU Agencies that hold experience in performing regulatory risk assessment and hold knowledge and data for such assessments. Through their experience they can identify gaps and needs requiring scientific development and steer such development in a direction that provides the highest value for the regulatory risk assessment. The EU Agencies will benefit from the participation as well. They can uptake immediately in the regulatory risk assessment any innovation in risk assessment that PARC will deliver.\n\n### **Projected impact on Agencies:**\n\n- Committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require involvement of Agencies' Committees/bodies\n- Data model and IT infrastructure: **no impact**. The task does not require any new data structures and IT systems/capabilities\n- Key experts: **medium impact**. The task will require experts in the field to participate in the projects.\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nECHA participates fully in the project (i.e. as a signatory of the consortium agreement) but without (co-)financing from the foreseen Horizon Europe subsidy to PARC and without requesting an increase of its EU contribution. To compensate for the workload that PARC will generate, ECHA will increase its allocation of Contract Agents by two and will finance them from economies of scale and efficiency gains. This solution will be temporary until the Commission revises the founding regulation of ECHA. This revision will be an opportunity to adjust and clarify the future mandate of ECHA in the light of the existing and new tasks and assess its resources needs. The role of ECHA in the research projects under Horizon Europe will also be clarified in the proposal.\n\nEFSA participates fully in the project (i.e. as a signatory of the consortium agreement) but without (co-)financing from the foreseen Horizon Europe subsidy to PARC and without requesting an increase of its EU contribution. EFSA has dedicated resources for involvement and follow up of relevant EU funded research projects.\n\nEEA participates fully in the project with (co-)financing from the Horizon Europe subsidy to PARC. EEA will finance from the subsidy 2 additional FTEs (2 CAs).\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks | Resource needs               |                                                                                                                      |\n|--------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EEA    |                  | Financial resource<br>needs: | 2022: EUR 289 000<br>2023: EUR 289 000<br>2024: EUR 289 000<br>2025: EUR 289 000<br>2026: EUR 289 000<br>2027: EUR 0 |\n|        |                  | Human resource<br>needs:     | 2022: 2 CA<br>2023: 2 CA<br>2024: 2 CA<br>2025: 2 CA<br>2026: 2 CA<br>2027: 0 CA                                     |\n| ECHA   |                  | Financial resource<br>needs: | 2022: EUR 0<br>2023: EUR 0<br>2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0                               |\n|        |                  | Human resource<br>needs:     | 2022: 2 CA<br>2023: 2 CA<br>2024: 2 CA<br>2025: 2 CA<br>2026: 2 CA<br>2027: 0 CA                                     |\n| EFSA   |                  | Financial resource<br>needs: | 2022: EUR 0<br>2023: EUR 0<br>2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0                               |\n|        |                  | Human resource<br>needs:     | 2022: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2023: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2024: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2025: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2026: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2027: 0 TA, 0 CA |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for PARC:\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment, DG GROW, DG RTD\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **4. COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION [2022/1979](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022D1979&qid=1681404756977) UNDER SEVESO DIRECTIVE**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission (DG JRC)\n\n### (Re-)attribution planned to: EEA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Commission Implementing Decision\n\n**Type of task:** existing tasks plus some improvements\n\n**Brief task overview:** Redevelopment of databases (eMARS and eSPIRS) by the EEA for the reporting of information on industrial major accidents and for reporting of the location of Seveso establishments. It will integrate some improvements in the reporting format, the workflow and the set of reporting tools.\n\n**Detailed process description:** The process is described in detail below in the section on projected workload\n\n**Proximity to mandate:** The task is close to EEA key competence on receiving and processing reporting information. The agency has the IT and networking infrastructure that is similar to the tasks, such as operation of the European pollutant release and transfer register, reporting under the industrial emission directive, the F-gas regulation or ozone depleting substances regulation.\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\n## **Main risks and opportunities:**\n\n### **Projected impact on EEA:**\n\n- EEA Committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require involvement of EEA Committees/bodies\n- EEA data model and IT infrastructure: **high impact**. The task requires investment in a new data structures and IT systems/capabilities\n- EEA key experts: **high impact**. The task will require a new dedicated expertise\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nThe development and operation of databases (eMARS and eSPIRS) for the reporting of information on industrial major accidents and for reporting of the location of Seveso establishments and providing supporting services was performed by DG JRC. The work was performed by 4 FTEs, 1 FTE was an official of DG JRC, and 3 FTEs were external consultants.\n\nCurrent budget line: DG JRC (core staff) + DG Environment (contractual support)\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\n### **A/ During the redevelopment phase of eSPIRS and eMARS (2023-2025)**\n\n### **IT infrastruture**\n\nOne-off cost:\n\n- EUR 275 000 and then EUR 200 000 are reserved for the two first years to set up the IT eSPIRS systems and the support of Member States to facilitate their reporting within the new platform, which will be developed by the EEA.\n\n- EUR 60 000 is reserved for the two first years to set up the IT eMARS systems. This amount is lower compared to eSPIRS because some tasks will be mutualised between eSPIRS and eMARS.\n\n#### Yearly cost:\n\n- From 2024, the running costs of the two databases require 70 000 EUR per year (hosting of tools, maintenance of software, infrastructure and support for the quality assurance of data deliveries).\n\n#### **Staff, 4 agents are needed for the period 2023-2025 for the following roles:**\n\n- **2 IT staff agents :** thanks to the mutualisation of tasks related to the IT deployment, continuous improvment and support to Member States for the the future eSPIRS and eMARS databases, the need of staff is limited to: one full-time equivalent temporary agent (AD TA) (average cost EUR 199 576/year) and one full-time equivalent contract agent staff (CA) (average cost EUR 107 666/year) at the EEA:\n  - o **1 AD TA\"IT expert – database systems redevelopment\". Objective**: to support the implementation of the new IT information system necessary for the eSPIRS and eMARS reporting:\n    - IT project management of the redevelopment of new tools and reporting system, ensuring design of alignment and complementarity with the existing EEA software used for the reporting of industrial information to the EU Registry on Industrial Sites. As part of the redevelopment and implementation of the new tools, the agent will lead on the following:\n      - Update the data model. This consists in the design and proposal of UML model, feature descriptions and deployment and updating the code lists.\n      - Support on updating the technical guidance.\n      - Integration of the data model changes across the reporting infrastracture. This includes, among others:\n        - o Update of the XML schema and EEA dictionary: the existing schemas and code lists in the EEA data dictionary have to be updated according to the agreed data model version.\n        - o Update of Quality Assurance (QA) scripts: with support from Member State Competentent Authorities, stakeholders and thematic experts (see below), the agent will assess the need of new automated Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) in view of the newly included reporting requirements. Should this be required, the agent will also integrate these in the reporting infrastructure. Changes in the logic of the data model may also need adjustments of existing QA/QC.\n        - o Update of conversion services: this refers to a service of converting an userfriendly template into EU Registry-compliant XML reports. This service will need to be updated.\n        - o Update of harvesting routines: this relates to updating the systems used to incorporate the data reported by Member States into the EEA databases.\n        - o Support for the update of the manual for reporters.\n      - Design and run tests for the future reporting tools.\n      - Launch and if necessary revise/adjust reporting tools: according to experience with the design and deployment of the EU Registry of indutrial sites, a period of around two reporting cycles is needed for all countries to fully succeed in sending high-quality data. The IT speecialist's role will be to incorporate possible\n\nchanges/adjustments to the reporting tools if necessary, as well as provide technical support to possible IT queries from Member States. It is expected that these will be more numerous and complex during this early period and will stabilise once all systems are in place.\n\n- Adjustment of public-facing products (IT):\n  - o Generation of EU datasets.\n  - o European Industrial Emissions Portal.\n- Whereas the data currently reported to eSPIRS could be integrated in the existing IT infrastructure (with the required changes outlined above), it is possible that eMARS will require its own database/IT infrastructure. This is mainly related to the nature of the data currently reported to eMARS and the specific legal requirements related to the rapid reporting of industrial accidents. The agent will evaluate the possible options and work on the design and development of such dedicated IT environment if necessary, as well as contribute to the development of its support documentation (e.g. manuals, guidance). Also, the agent will provide their IT expertise in the process of amending Commission Implementing Decision (CID) 2014/895/EU establishing the format for communicating the information referred to in Article 21(3) of Directive 2012/18/EU (i.e. implementing the reporting of accidents, i.e. the eMARS dataflow). This will ensure the language and structure of the Decision are suitable, clear and compatible with the fture IT requirements.\n- Performing the internal EEA function of \"data custodian\" involving the maintenance of databases, developing and updating automated quality assurance scripts, data harvesting scripts and IT dimensions of updating the website European Industrial Emission Portal.\n- Ensuring that confidentiality, data protection and IT security protocols are maintained to the standards required by the EU Institutions, from the design phase throughout the pre-operational and operational phases.\n- Ensuring a secure access and use of the data that are marked as confidential, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2003/4/EC<sup>49</sup>. These data shall neither be publically available nor accessible (directly or indirectly).\n- o **1 CA \"Member State and stakeholder support\". Objective**: to support the transition to the future tools with the following tasks:\n  - Support to the development of the technical guidance for reporters. This support will focus on coordinating the stakeholder validation of the technical materials by the reporters' community and incorporate their feedback in the materials. The agent will engage with the current community of Seveso reporters and will also coordinate contacts with EU registry reporters, who will also be affected by the changes and who will have to liaise with their colleagues reporting on Seveso for the submission of data. The agent's role early on in the process is crucial for ensuring that the system is fit for purpose and incorporates the realities of all EU Member States.\n  - Support on Member State validation of new automated QA/QC checks and on obtaining feedback during the necessary testing phase/s for the tools.\n  - Support on Member State validation of manual for reporters.\n\n<sup>49</sup> Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information\n\n▪ From a strategic point of view and in view of the experience with the EU Registry, building the foundation of a efficient relationship with the Seveso community of reporters requires time. Starting this at the development phase is also relevant for a smooth run of the process once implemented and ensures dedicated support and validation to minimise the risk of unnecessary changes and issues later in the process.\n\n- **2 thematic staff agents for for eSPIRS and eMARS:** 2 full-time equivalent temporary agents (AD TA) at the EEA (average cost EUR 199 576/year) for the thematic and analytic tasks linked to eSPIRS and eMARS:\n\n- o **1 AD TA \"Subject matter expert – eSPIRS Seveso reporting\".

In addition, ECHA would prepare a mapping study by 31/12/2026 on substances of concern present in batteries or used in their manufacturing, in order to assist the Commission to prepare such report to the European Parliament and Council by 31/12/2027.\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\n### Current process:\n\nN/A, no process exists at EU level\n\n<sup>52</sup> Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information\n\n#### New process:\n\n- 1. If the Commission considers that the use of a substance in the manufacture of batteries, or the presence of a substance in the batteries when they are placed on the market, or during their subsequent life cycle stages, including the waste phase, poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not adequately controlled and needs to be addressed on a Union-wide basis, it shall request the European Chemicals Agency (the 'Agency') to prepare a dossier that conforms to the requirements of point (3) of Part II of Annex XV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 ('restriction dossier'). The restriction dossier shall include a socio-economic assessment, including an analysis of alternatives.\n- 2. The Agency shall publish without delay the intention of the Commission to initiate such restriction process life cycle for a substance, and shall inform stakeholders concerned.\n- 3. Within 12 months of the receipt of the request from the Commission in paragraph 1 and if the restriction dossier prepared by the Agency pursuant to that paragraph demonstrates that action is necessary on a Union-wide basis, the Agency shall suggest restrictions in order to initiate the restriction process described in paragraphs 4 to 14.\n- 4. The Agency shall make publicly available on its website the restriction dossier, including the restrictions suggested pursuant to paragraph 3, without delay, clearly indicating the date of publication. The Agency shall invite all interested parties to submit individually or jointly, within four months of the date of publication, comments on the restriction dossier.\n- 5. Within 12 months of the date of publication referred to in paragraph 4, the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC), set up pursuant to Article 76(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, shall adopt an opinion as to whether the suggested restrictions are appropriate in reducing the risk to human health and/or the environment, based on its consideration of the relevant parts of the restriction dossier. This opinion shall take account of the restriction dossier prepared by the Agency at the request of the Commission, and the views of interested parties referred to in paragraph 4.\n- 6. Within 15 months of the date of publication referred to in paragraph 4, the Committee for Socioeconomic Analysis (SEAC), set up pursuant to Article 76(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, shall adopt an opinion on the suggested restrictions, based on its consideration of the relevant parts of the dossier and the socio-economic impact. Prior to that, it shall prepare a draft opinion on the suggested restrictions and on the related socio-economic impact, taking account of the analyses or information according to paragraph 4, if there are any.\n- 7. The Agency shall publish the draft opinion of the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis on its website without delay and invite interested parties to provide their comments on the draft opinion no later than 60 days from the publication of that draft opinion.\n- 8. The Committee for Socio-economic Analysis shall without delay adopt its opinion, taking into account where appropriate further comments received by the deadline set in paragraph 7. This opinion shall take account of the comments of interested parties submitted under paragraphs 4 and 7.\n- 9. Where the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment diverges significantly from the restrictions suggested, the Agency shall postpone the deadline for the opinion of the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis by a maximum of 90 days.\n- 10. The Agency shall submit to the Commission without delay the opinions of the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socio-economic Analysis on the restrictions suggested pursuant to the request made by the Commission under paragraph 1. Where the opinions of the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socio-economic Analysis diverge significantly from the restrictions suggested pursuant to paragraph 3, the Agency shall submit an explanatory note to the Commission providing a detailed explanation of the reasons for such differences. If one or both\n\nof the Committees do not adopt an opinion by the deadline set in paragraphs 5 and 6 the Agency shall inform the Commission accordingly, stating the reasons.\n\n- 11. The Agency shall publish the opinions of the two Committees on its website without delay.\n- 12. The Agency shall provide the Commission on request with all documents and evidence submitted to or considered by it.\n- 13. If the Commission concludes that the conditions laid down in Article 6(2) are fulfilled, it shall adopt a delegated act pursuant to Article 6(2). This delegated act shall be adopted without undue delay following the receipt of the opinion of the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis referred to in paragraph 8 or after the deadline set out under paragraphs 6 and 9, as applicable, if that Committee does not adopt an opinion.\n- 14. Where the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socio-economic Analysis provide an opinion pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6, they shall make use of rapporteurs as specified in Article 87 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. The rapporteurs or co-rapporteurs concerned, or their employer, shall be remunerated by the Agency in accordance with a scale of fees to be included in the financial arrangements related to restrictions established by the Management Board, set up pursuant to Article 76(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Where the persons concerned fail to fulfil their duties, the Executive Director of the Agency has the right to terminate or suspend the contract or withhold remuneration\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The battery restriction process, although not identical, is very similar to the REACH restriction process and the same scientific methodologies can be applied. The substances under scrutiny are the same or similar to those under REACH and REACH (and other ECHA) data and processes can be reused for battery restriction dossier development and opinion forming. ECHA holds the right competences to manage the battery restriction process, however, does not have sufficient information on the exact use of substances in batteries, which is to be remedied with a study to be commissioned.\n\n| Type                     | Synergy |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High    | Process and expertise: ECHA already supports similar work<br>on substance restrictions under REACH and other<br>legislation.

The task partly relies on existing expert competencies which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR *regulatory tasks*\n\n# **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nN/A, no current process exists at EU level\n\n## Future workload and resource needs:\n\nA total of 2 new full-time equivalent temporary agent staff (AD 5-7) at ECHA (average cost EUR 171 000/year with coefficient for FI and annual indexation over 4 years and beyond) will be needed to make sure that sufficient resources would be earmarked for regulating the necessary battery related substances without competing with REACH priorities. This covers an average of one additional restriction (or other risk management measure) yearly, including risk assessment of lead in lead-acid batteries, and of mercury and cadmium used in electric vehicle batteries.\n\nIn addition, 1 full-time equivalent contract agent staff for 3 years (CA FG III, average cost EUR 91 000/year with coefficient for FI and annual indexation over 3 years), will be necessary to increase the knowledge base and carry out a mapping of substances of concerns used in batteries, facilitating an informed priority setting and work plan establishment. This will be based on a mapping study to build ECHA's current knowledge on how the battery industry manages its hazardous chemicals to identify relevant substances for regulatory risk management in the future. The study is estimted at EUR 400 000 (over 3 years) to outsource part of such research needs.\n\nA sum of EUR 22 000 is also required to cover the cost of the rapporteurs (Member State experts guiding the dossiers through the opinion-making in the RAC and SEAC committees) for each restriction, as well as EUR 43 000 over 4 years for covering a proportionate part of the full cost of organising the RAC and SEAC meetings (travel, accommodation and daily allowance costs: cost calculated based on the average time/effort needed for a restriction dossier in both committees).\n\nThe aforementioned resources have been estimated using a calculation model which takes account of relevant experience from tasks executed by ECHA under other regulatory frameworks (e.g. REACH, CLP, BPR) and from the implementation of the existing national approaches where relevant. It sets out the resources that will be needed by ECHA over 2024-2027 and beyond, in order to handle the foreseen tasks.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Resource needs                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Assessment underlying the restriction of hazardous substances in batteries (1 restriction / year)  Substance prioritisation and data analytics Restriction dossier development RAC opinion development SEAC opinion development Dissemination | Financial resource needs:<br>Human resource needs: | 2023: EUR 158 000<br>2024: EUR 158 000<br>2025: EUR 158 000<br>2026: EUR 25 000<br>2027: EUR 25 000<br>2028: EUR 25 000<br>2023: 2 TA, 1 CA<br>2024: 2 TA, 1 CA<br>2025: 2 TA, 1 CA<br>2026: 2 TA, 0 CA<br>2027: 2 TA, 0 CA<br>2028: 2 TA, 0 CA |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the batteries regulation:\n\n# **6.

The existing EPRTR is replaced by an Industrial Emissions Portal that should be operated by EEA too. The new Portal should contain more data and provide more functionalities as compared to the old EPRTR. The Portal should provide information on emission for more substances, for more installations and for more activities. It should also provides information on the use of water, energy and raw materials by the concerned installations to allow monitoring of progress towards a circular, highly resource-efficient economy.\n\n**Proximity to EEA mandate:** The operation of the Industrial Emission Portal fits well within the mandate of EEA. EEA already operates the existing EPRTR and the new Portal has evolved from the EPRTR.\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | High      | Process and expertise: EEA already operates EPRTR, manages<br>reporting flows from installations and Member States and manages<br>related environmental information on air quality and water quality.<br>Several key capacities can be reused and further developed. |\n| Re-use of data                                       | High      | Reuse of data collected under other environmental legislation (air<br>and water) can be combined.                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| IT tools:<br>automation<br>and economies<br>of scale | High      | The existing IT capabilities can be partly reused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Support<br>services:<br>economies of<br>scale        | High      | Reuse of support services for reporting and data management.<br>Reuse of administrative services.                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\n### **Main risks and opportunities:** N/A\n\n### **Projected impact on EEA:**\n\n- EEA Committees/bodies: **no impact**.

Costs of developing IT infrastructure will go down in the 3rd year, as only the IT infrastructure maintenance costs will remain. It's assumed that for the first two years EEA will need more financial resources to revamp the existing tools as a result of the legal proposal.\n\nEEA staff will establish the IT infrastructure that will be required to implement the proposed revisions and subsequently manage the reporting and related dataflow. These IT enhancements relate to the physical capacity of the reporting stream (i.e. number and nature of reports) and the supporting systems (guidance, training etc.) to ensure their consistent application by industrial operators and Member States.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                               | Resource needs              |                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EEA    | Establishing and operating the IT infrastructure for collecting new data fields<br>Updating the manual for reporters<br>Run training sessions for MS reporters | Operational resource needs: | 2024: EUR 170 000<br>2025: EUR 70 000<br>2026: EUR 30 000<br>2027: EUR 30 000<br>Human resource needs:<br>2024: 2 TAs, 0 CA<br>2025: 2 TAs, 0 CA<br>2026: 2 TAs, 0 CA<br>2027: 2 TAs, 0 CA |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for E-PRTR regulation:\n\n## Budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **7. INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS DIRECTIVE (2010/75/EU)**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: N/A, no current process\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Revision of the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU)\n\n**Type of task:** new\n\n**Brief task overview:** ECHA has already for some time provided input to the Commission to the review of the Best Available Techniques Reference documents (BREF). Now ECHA's role has been formalised as part of this revised proposal. Overall, ECHA's role would include routine support to BREF/BAT and support to design/ implementation of the Chemicals Management System (CMS) methodology.\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n## Current process:\n\nN/A, no process exists at EU level\n\nNew process:\n\nWhile ECHA has already done some work in this area, the Commission has now proposed giving ECHA a formal role in drawing up BAT reference documents (BREFs).\n\nThe role of ECHA would be to ensure that:\n\n- An appropriate identification (and if necessary selection) of relevant substances for each sector/BREF is made. This will include a characterisation of the uses of those substances by sectors covered by BREFs including definition of best practices to use the safest alternatives on the market. This will improve clarity and consistency of the various legislations (IED, REACH, CLP)\n- The correct terminology is used in the BREF processes (e.g. substance, process chemical, raw material)\n- The chemicals-related BATs (such as substitution techniques) are technically sound\n- Background documents, for Kick off Meeting and final meeting, drafted by the EIPPCB are relevant regarding chemicals issue\n- Assistance is provided to the EIPPCB to access the information on ECHA's database\n- Assistance is provided to answer stakeholders questions or comments where a chemicals expertise is needed\n\nThe Commission would facilitate this work by organising an exchange of information between the concerned industries, Member States, NGOs and ECHA. In addition, by 2024, ECHA should start building a methodology for on-site risk assessment to actively manage input chemicals and resulting emissions.\n\nIn short ECHA's new tasks would include the following:\n\n- Data mining of ECHA databases and generating a list of hazardous substances potentially used in BREF sectors; extract substance-related information (regulatory status, classification, substance identity), characterise the uses of those substances by sectors covered by BREFs including definition of best practices to use the safest alternatives on the market, and provide technical support to BREF revisions (TWG meetings, review, other technical inputs).\n- Develop guiding principles for the Chemicals Management System focussing on data structure and methodologies for a site inventory of chemicals (substances and mixtures) associated with further development of a site-level risk assessment methodology and contribute to the development of guiding principles on how to conduct a comparative risk assessment between the substances an operator uses for his processes/products and potential alternatives.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** This new task would mainly be the formalisation of a task already performed by ECHA on an ad hoc basis, with the addition of support to design/ implement the CMS methodology.\n\n| Type                     | Synergies                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High Process and expertise: ECHA already provides scientific advice on chemical substances and as it has supported related ad hoc advice requests in the past, it already has the needed expertise.

Assessments underpinning amendment of priority list of substances and derivation of Environmental Quality Standards under EQS Directive;\n- 2. New legal task: EU-wide EQS for substances listed in a (new) Annex II of the EQSD including the so-called 'River Basin Specific Pollutants' (two per year); EU-wide threshold values for groundwater pollutants (one per year) to be included in Annex II GWD\n- 3. Assessment underpinning review of Annexes I and II of the Groundwater Directive;\n- 4. Technical and scientific work related to amendment of 'watch list' and coordination of 'watch list' activities both under EQS and Groundwater Directives.\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n### Current process\n\n### *Summary process description*\n\nSurface water:\n\nWatchlist and priority list work currently done by JRC and after that a SCHEER opinion. IA of EQS proposals for new substances on the Priority Substance (PS) list outsourced to contractor. For future: Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) not needed for identification of substances for monitoring (watch list). ECHA involvement lighter, but heavier for 6y priority setting, including RAC.\n\n- Watch List: identifying new substances for and removing substances from the Watch List (amendment needed every 2 years (EQSD Article 8b(2)). The Commission is considering moving to a three-year review cycle)\n  - o Proposals for adding and removing substances (including mixtures): usually ca. 10 substances / mixtures on watch list (based on literature overviews, information resulting from other legislation)\n  - o Establishment/identification of the related PNECs. No RAC involvement.\n  - o Verification of the suitability and availability of monitoring and analytical methods not entailing significant costs, and compilation of information on these for Member States;\n\nIssue is often absence of monitoring methods, otherwise nothing can be monitored. ECHA to check availability and suitability of tests. This work we haven't done much in the past. Registrants have to supply appropriate analytical methods for their substances, follow-up more now. ECHA could run a consultation to identify available analytical methods. However, ECHA does not have the expertise to also test their suitability, so it would preferably outsource such task to a scientific institute.\n\n- o Assessment of monitoring results in view of identifying the need for setting EU wide or national EQS (based on importance, frequency, impact of exceedances)\n- Priority List: technical work on reviewing the PS list (six-year review cycle; through delegated acts)\n  - o Prioritisation work\n  - o Establishment of EQSs for new (groups of) PS or trigger values for (effect-based) groups of PS\n\n- o Development of a final proposal (on new and revised PS/PHS, EQS), supported by an opinion from the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) and from the Committee for Socio-Economic Assessment\n- o Regular discussion and presentation in the WG Chemicals or related subgroup\n- New 1 (similar to current task 2 under GWD): EU-wide EQS for substances listed in a (new) Annex II of the EQSD including the so-called 'River Basin Specific Pollutants' (RBSP) formerly part of the 'ecological status' component of surface water status. The intention is that MS will apply the listed EQS (rather than national EQS) if they identify the substances as posing a risk; MS will be asked to upload/send these national EQS for uploading in the EU wide Repository to be established by ECHA; this will enable ECHA to assist EC in prioritising RBSPs for which the largest divergences have been identified without those being justified; and develop the EU-wide EQS; the latter would be adopted through delegated acts; timeline: one EQS per year, adoption by delegated act every six years. Difference with EU EQS for priority substances apply in all cases, i.e. the substances are prioritised because of their overall EU concern; for EQS for RBSPs, MS should in principle establish themselves EQS whenever an RBSP is of national/local concern; but even for these, where it appears that divergences are too wide between MS without this being justified; there is a need to set EU wide EQS, to be applied however only when there is a national or local issuer\n- New 2: identification of suitable monitoring methods for monitoring and analysis of PFAS, by 2 years after entry into force and for microplastics (2 years) and Antimicrobiotical resistance genes (AMR) (2 years).\n\n### Groundwater:\n\nGroundwater: no JRC involvement currently, most work done by Member State expert group and contractor and outcome sent to SCHEER\n\n- Specific technical work on six-yearly reviewing the pollutants and quality standards in Annex I\n- New: Six yearly review of list of pollutants in Annex II for which MS must consider setting national thresholds if there is a local/regional/national problem (difference with Annex I which relates to pollutants of EU wide concern)\n- New: develop/identify EU wide threshold values for pollutants currently covered by a national threshold value (in Annex II), where necessary to ensure better and more harmonised implementation: one per year, threshold values to be adopted by delegated act once every six years\n- In summary, review of the pollutants listed in the two annexes and of the quality standards in Annex I and development of EU wide threshold values for pollutants listed in Annex II. proposals for the amendment of Annexes I and II, based on scientific and technical evidence; Development of proposals for the amendment of Annexes I and II, based on scientific and technical evidence; Opinion development via the RAC and SEAC committee; regular presentation and discussion in the WG Groundwater.\n- New: mandatory Watch List:\n  - o Proposals for adding and removing substances\n  - o Verification of the suitability and availability of monitoring and analytical methods not entailing significant costs, and compilation of information on these for MS\n  - o Development of the related PNECs. No RAC involvement\n- New: identification of suitable monitoring methods for monitoring and analysis of PFAS, by 2 years after entry into force and for microplastics (2 years) and Antimicrobiotical resistance genes (AMR) [2 years].\n\n# *Detailed description of current process*\n\nAmendment of the list of priority substances for surface waters and development of Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), including designation of Priority Hazardous Substances (from Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and its daughter directive EQS Directive (2008/105/EC) as amended by 2013/39/EU):\n\n- The amendment (and associated technical and scientific work) is initiated by the Commission.\n- Consultant and/or JRC prioritises substances to be included in the list of priority substance (PSlist) using a combination of monitoring-based approach and modelling-based approach, including the results of the watch-list monitoring. Their work is regularly discussed in a sub-group of the CIS WG Chemicals known as the Sub-Group on Review (SG-R) of the PS list. The outcome is a ranking of substances based on their potential risks. (~ REACH prioritisation of candidate substances for further risk management)\n- Consultant and/or JRC reviews the existing PS-list with a view to determine whether some should be taken off the PS-list. A document has been drafted identifying potential criteria for removing substances, considering that even if existing PS no longer pose a risk, removing them could result in them again becoming a risk, unless their use has been banned.\n- Commission (DG ENV) in consultation with WG Chemicals selects substances for which EQS are derived and which of the listed substances should be designated as priority hazardous substances.\n- Commission (consultants, JRC) or volunteer Member States derive EQS for newly selected PS (groups of PS), and review EQS for existing PS if new data are available. The work is organised in subgroups for specific substances, led by the consultants, JRC or volunteer Member State experts and are also discussed in WG Chemicals, subject to public open and targeted consultation and specific technical workshops with experts under the IA support contract. (~derivation of/proposal for Exposure Limits) (~stakeholder and public consultation) (~Adaptation to Technical Progress)\n- Commission consults SCHEER on EQS derivation. (~RAC opinions)\n- Consultants prepare an impact assessment study of listing of a substance in the PS-list. (~Socioeconomic Assessment – SEAC opinion)\n- Commission makes a proposal for listing the substances in the PS-list and for setting EQS values. The proposal goes through the ordinary legislative procedure.\n- Updated Annexes are published by the Commission.\n\nReview and amendment of the surface-water watch-list (from EQS Directive (2008/105/EC) as amended by 2013/39/EU):\n\n- The amendment (and associated technical and scientific work) is initiated by the Commission.\n- Consultant and/or JRC performs prioritisation exercise. EQSD Article 8b(1) specifies the information to be taken into account. It is important to have an estimate of the PNEC (~derivation of PNEC) and to ensure that an adequately sensitive analytical method is available.\n- JRC reviews the existing watch-list with a view to taking substances off the list. The substances can only stay on for up to 4 years, but if sufficient high-quality monitoring data are obtained sooner, they should be removed (~hazard assessment?) (~proposal for identification of candidate substances).\n- The review of the watch-list is carried out in consultation with WG Chemicals.\n- The Commission adopts a new watch-list in the form of an Implementing Act subject to agreement in the WFD Regulatory Committee.\n- Member States performs the monitoring and report data to EEA.\n\n• JRC analyses the monitoring data whether there is an EU-wide risk.\n\nReview of Annexes I and II and Voluntary groundwater watch-list (from Ground water directive (2006/118/EC)):\n\n- The amendment (and associated technical and scientific work) is initiated by the Commission under its legal obligation (GWD art. 10). This was initiated after the WFD fitness check conclusions (2019), but technical works of the watch list started already in 2015.\n- Commission and CIS WG Groundwater consultant with the technical and scientific support of the specific subgroup collects data and prioritises substances to be included in the annexes using an agreed methodology (2018). These are included in a 'List facilitating the review'. (When there are insufficient monitoring data, substances are proposed for the voluntary watch-list). Prioritization and selection process involves several steps, and relies upon aggregate data from national entities across Europe on substance occurrence in groundwater, as well as available data on substance persistence, mobility, toxicity, and bioaccumulation behaviour. The work is regularly shared with CIS WG Chemicals and JRC.\n- Based on updated monitoring data, the consultant reviews the existing voluntary watch-list and list facilitating the review with a view of adding substances to the lists. Outcomes are provided to Commission and shared/discussed with WG Groundwater experts.\n- Commission proposes substances for potential inclusion in the two annexes. These are also considered in the Impact Assessment (IA) Support Study policy options and corresponding economic analysis (consultants).\n- Commission (JRC or consultant) propose potential quality standards for newly proposed substances for Annex I and II. These are also shared with WG Groundwater experts, subject to public open and targeted consultation and specific technical workshop with groundwater experts under the IA support contract.\n- The Commission consults the SCHEER on selection of substances and the derivation of EU quality standards (also consulting whether any of the proposed substances should be considered for Annex II, in which case MS are to derive threshold values).\n- Consultants carry out an impact assessment support study of policy options that consider listing substances in Annex I (with EU quality standard) or Annex II.\n- Commission makes a proposal for listing the substances in Annex I of the Groundwater Directive (and EU quality standards if proposed for Annex I) or for adding substances in Annex II. The proposal for Annex I goes through the ordinary legislative procedure; the proposal for Annex II goes through 'comitology: regulatory procedure with scrutiny' (last review took place in 2014).\n- Updated Annexes are published by the Commission.\n\nAdditional details for the voluntary groundwater watch list mechanism (progresses and outcomes regularly shared with WG Chemicals and JRC).\n\n- Consultant and group of volunteers within CIS WG Groundwater performs prioritisation exercise (groups of substances), collects data and runs agreed methodology.\n- Consultant reviews the existing voluntary watch list and list facilitating (substances with enough monitoring information that can be proposed for the GWD Annexes review) with a view adding substances to the lists.\n- The review of the voluntary WL list and list facilitating is carried out in consultation with the group of volunteers (within WG Groundwater).\n- The Commission agrees (Water Directors acknowledge) on a new voluntary watch list. The Commission considers list facilitating for the formal process of the GWD Annexes review.\n- Member States perform monitoring on voluntary basis for the watch list and list facilitating substances and report data to consultant. For quality standards and threshold values MS report on\n\npollutants causing failure and risk, exceedances and trends (among other) though established WFD reporting system.\n\n• Consultant assesses data provided on voluntary basis. EEA analyses the reported monitoring data under WFD scheme.\n\nChanges envisaged as part of reattribution: Yes\n\n- In the past only voluntary watch list under groundwater directive. Obligatory watch list would be new.\n- New legal task: EU-wide EQS for substances listed in a (new) Annex II of the EQSD including the so-called 'River Basin Specific Pollutants';\n- New legal task: EU wide threshold values for pollutants listed in Annex II GWD (where too wide divergences exist between national standards);\n- Explicit identification, within 2 years of entry into force, of suitable monitoring methods for monitoring and analysis of PFAS, and for microplastics and Antimicrobiotical resistance genes (AMR)[2 years], for both SW and GW (in addition to the regular verification of the suitability and availability of monitoring and analytical methods not entailing significant costs for substances proposed to be listed in the Watch Lists under both directives)\n- Groundwater Directive: verification of the suitability and availability of monitoring and analytical methods not entailing significant costs, and compilation of information on these for MS. This task existed, but was never performed.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The works seems close to the ECHA core mandate, especially for the EQSD / priority setting.

From that list the SCHEER provided opinions on a total of 45 EQS during the last 10-12 years (average of 4 EQS per year) as follows:\n\n- 2022: EQS for 14 priority substances + 4 pending + groundwater standards pending for several substances\n- 2021: EQS for 3 priority substances\n- 2012: EQS for 1 substance\n- 2011: EQS for 23 substances\n\nAlso, if one looks at the last 6-year review cycle in 2022 when 22 substances were added to the Priority List, one comes to an average of 4 substances per year if the workload needs to be annualised.\n\n## *Past workload for groundwater:*\n\nIn the past only voluntary watch list under groundwater directive. Obligatory watch list would be new, align two directives. Currently only 2 pharmaceuticals for EU standard and 1 for MS monitoring. A few substances will be added in 2022.\n\n*Resources used currently for EQSD (surface water):*\n\nWatchlist and derivation of EQS for new Priority (hazardous) substances is currently led by JRC (in house and contractors) and the list of P(H)S and related EQS are submitted to a SCHEER opinion. SCHEER has delivered 45 opinions in the period between 2011 – 2022 (average of 4/year). IA of EQS proposals for new substances on the PS list outsourced to contractor; regular discussion and presentation in Working Group Chemicals.\n\nJRC staff permanent+ JRC consultant work Watch List and Annex I EQS list PS and EQS = EUR 1 392 181 (AAs with JRC) over 6 years, i.e. EUR 232 030 per year; if we calculate yearly consultant cost at EUR 66 000, this would make **ca 3.5 FTE plus 1 FTE** (one permanent staff)/year.\n\nIn addition, part of the impact assessment was carried out under IA contract DG ENV = relevant part of IA contract was about EUR 100 000; i.e. Ca. 1.5 FTE over six years = **0.25 FTE** per year\n\nThe SCHEER Committee serves water legislation for approximately 1/3rd of its capacity (17 opinions out of 51 during 2016-2022). SCHEER has 17 (external) scientists per mandate that are remunerated for their work. DG SANTE provides the secretariat to the SCCS and SCHEER that consists of 4 FTE + 2 FTE for technical and administrative support (literature search, editing and proofreading of opinions, website mastering, assistance for the Health-EU newsletter, dissemination activities). **Costs for renumeration of members of the committee are ca. EUR 93 134 per year** (30% of 310 447,08 (the total cost of SCHEER activities in 2019 consisting of indemnities, travel cost and daily allowances for the members).\n\n**The total resources used**: **6.1 FTEs** (4.5 FTE/year (Scientific work) + 1.35 FTE/year (committee secretariat) + 0.25 FTE/year (impact assessment via contract)) + **costs of renumeration of members of the committee of ca. EUR 93 134 per year**\n\n# *Resources used currently for GWD (ground water)*\n\nNo JRC involvement currently, most work on voluntary watch list mechanism is done by MS expert group and contractor; outcome of that work is sent to SCHEER for updating of Annex I; for the current proposal of additional 4 groups of substances one single opinion was provided (one file covering all pollutants).\n\nDG ENV consultants for voluntary watch list groundwater = 4 low volume contracts at cost of EUR 57 000 = approximately 1 FTE over six years = **0.16 FTE** per year\n\nIn addition: contributions from MS; EC and JRC permanent staff (already estimated under 'Surface water' and SCHEER opinion (one opinion on total amount of substances proposed for Annex I).\n\n## Future policy trends, workload drivers and ECHA resource needs\n\n## *Commission's calculation method:*\n\nIf we estimate the additional cost of the new tasks introduced under the proposal, i.e. additional 2 EQS per year for Annex II EQSD and GWD and additional 1,5 substances/pollutants to be identified per year for Watch List GW (proposed 5 substances every 3 years, i.e. 10 over six years i.e. approximately 1.5 per year): so this would add up to approximately 35% of the current 6.26 FTE (4 opinions per year, plus Watch List with double amount of substances), i.e. in total 6.26 FTE plus 2.25 FTE which **would make approximately 8.5 FTE**.\n\nTo compare this estimate of current expenditure with the proposal from ECHA we would need to add the estimated amount for the development and/or identification of monitoring and analysis methods for total PFAS (note that for microplastics and for AMR, since these will be part of the 'normal' Watch list mechanism, the identification of methodologies would supposedly be covered by the normal 'Watch list support');\n\nFor JRC is currently working on a methodology for measuring microplastics in drinking water (budget of EUR 300 000), to be adopted by delegated act in Jan 2024. A contract is being launched for the development of technical guidelines on analytical methods for PFAS (mainly 'PFAS Total') in drinking water (budget EUR 200 000); also to be established by Jan 2024. It is likely that the work required for developing or identifying methodologies for microplastics and total PFAS in surface and in groundwater bodies will benefit from the work carried out under the drinking water directive, possibly resulting in slightly lower estimates.\n\n### *ECHA's calculation method:*\n\nThe priority setting process is similar work to REACH Annex XIV prioritisation, while the setting of EQS as well as reviewing the substances and quality standards in Annexes I and II to the GWD) is assumed similar to deriving Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs), with an average cost in ECHA of 0.7 FTE / substance. This however does not yet include the provision of a socio-economic analysis / impact assessment via the SEAC committee, which would add an additional 0.3-0.5 FTE (estimate made in the past for possible socio-economic assessment work for OELs).\n\nAlso, the surface water and groundwater watchlist process, and especially the setting of PNECs, is assumed similar to deriving OELs, with an average cost in ECHA of 0.7 FTE / substance. However, this process would potentially not include committee opinion forming, so the cost is estimated to be half lighter at 0.35 FTE / substance.\n\nAnnual ECHA resource needs:\n\n- The following resource estimates correspond to the \"ECHA way\", i.e. implementing similar processes and similar level of digitalisation to what is in place for ECHA's current tasks. Such examples would be the creation of registries of intentions and the dissemination of lists (watch lists, priority lists) as structured data. The benefit of this approach is to ensure a consistent standard of scientific quality, transparency, data searchability and interoperability.\n- **Both for Groundwater and surface water**: verification of the suitability and availability of monitoring and analytical methods not entailing significant costs, and compilation of information on these for MS: **0.5 FTE** for running a public consultation on available methods, scientific support and contract management of the second part of the task to assess suitability of analytical methods which would be outsourced to a scientific institute at ca. EUR 70 000 annually;\n- Identification of suitable monitoring and analytical methods for microplastics, PFAS and AMR within two years after entry into force: resource needs covered under the bullet point above;\n- Identifying and setting PNECs for 5 **groundwater** watch list substances every 3 years: **0.5 FTE annually** (~unit cost of 1 'light' OEL without committee involvement = 0.35 FTE);\n- **Groundwater**: Specific technical work on six-yearly review of the pollutants and quality standards in Annex I and possible updating of Annex II (listing pollutants for which MS must set national thresholds) to the GWD: six year cycle review of the pollutants listed in the two annexes and of the quality standards in Annex I. Development of proposals for the amendment of Annexes I and II, based on scientific and technical evidence: review 1 substance annually: **1 FTE annually** (~unit cost of 1 OEL, incl. RAC + SEAC = 1 FTE);\n- Priority setting process **groundwater**, identifying substances where national thresholds apply but wide divergences exist, identification of EU wide thresholds for pollutants in Annex II; one per year, to be included in a delegated act every six years: **1 FTE annually** (~unit cost of 1 OEL, incl.

Developing a proposal for harmonised classification\n- 2. Opinion on a proposal for harmonised classification\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n### Current process:\n\nFor hazards of highest concern (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity (CMR) and respiratory sensitisers) and for other substances on a case-by-case basis, classification and labelling should be harmonised throughout the EU to ensure an adequate risk management. This is done through harmonised classification and labelling (CLH). Harmonised classifications are listed in Annex VI to the CLP Regulation.\n\nThe process for harmonised classification is as follows:\n\ni. Member State (or industry under certain conditions) submits proposal for harmonised classification to ECHA. There is no legal obligation to do this; it is at the MS' (or industry's) discretion.\n\n- ii. RAC provides an opinion on harmonised classification.\n- iii. ECHA sends opinion to COM\n- iv. 'Where appropriate', COM formalises classification through addition of substance to Annex VI to CLP\n\n### Future process:\n\nECHA or EFSA, on the request of the Commission, will be obliged to develop a proposal for harmonised classification.\n\n**Proximity to Agency mandate:** The task fits well with the mandates of ECHA and EFSA. Both agencies are already involved in hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. ECHA already manages the process of RAC opinion making on proposals for harmonised classification and other provisions of CLP regulation.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:** Higher capacity to agree on harmonised classification for substances and the possibility to solve divergent opinions among agencies as regards hazard assessment is the key added value.\n\n| Type                                                    | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                                | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already supports work under the CLP<br>regulation including opinion making on harmonised classification and<br>performs risk and hazard assessment under other pieces of legislation.<br>Several key capacities can be reused/reinforced:<br>- Hazard assessment<br>- Committee opinion development<br>- Existing IT capabilities for dossier submission, stakeholder<br>consultation and dissemination |\n| Re-use of<br>data                                       | Medium    | Reuse of substance identification and hazard data collected under<br>other chemical legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Workload<br>balancing                                   | Low       | With an estimated workload of developing 5 proposals annually, there<br>is little room for workload balancing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| IT tools:<br>automation<br>and<br>economies of<br>scale | High      | Reuse of IT capabilities for case management, public consultation,<br>interaction with Member States, regulatory intentions management<br>and data dissemination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Support<br>services:<br>economies of<br>scale           | High      | Reuse of scientific support services<br>(e.g. committee secretariat,<br>prioritisation and grouping of substances, substance identification,<br>data management<br>and dissemination).

It is expected that the dossiers to be prepared are to be of lower complexity than medium, but higher than low complexity dossiers, i.e. having an average resource requirement of 0.4 FTE per dossier. This would result in the need of 5 FTEs per year to process 12.5 dossiers/year. Normally, there is a need for the contribution of 15% for the development and maintenance of common IT components (0.75 FTE) and for the contribution of 15% for the horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead) (0.75 FTE per year). However, as this is an extension of existing CLH process in the agency and the process and structures are fully in place, there is no need for these additional overhead contributions. Therefore, in total, there is a need of **5 FTEs per year**.\n\nEFSA will need to prepare up to 1 dossier per year, which is possible to be absorbed by its resources for the plant protection products.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                           | Resource needs                                  |                                                                              |                                                          |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | - Preparing classification dossiers (12.5 per year)<br>- Assessing classification dossiers (13.5 per year) | Financial resource needs:                       | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0                     |                                                          |\n|        |                                                                                                            | Human resource needs:                           | 2024: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2025: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2026: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2027: 3 TA, 2 CA |                                                          |\n|        | EFSA                                                                                                       | - Preparing classification dossier (1 per year) | Financial resource needs:                                                    | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0 |\n|        |                                                                                                            |                                                 | Human resource needs:                                                        | 2024: 0 FTE<br>2025: 0 FTE<br>2026: 0 FTE                |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the CLP regulation:\n\nFuture budget line: DG GROW\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n## **10.

This study, will determine the conditions under which the concentration level of certain substances of concern, do not apply to recycled materials and to product loops which are in a closed and controlled chain. It will also detail the reasoning of setting exemptions from the requirements of the proposed regulation for certain types of packaging.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** This task fits very well with the ECHA's core mandate, as it is a REACH restriction. ECHA holds the right competences to manage the packaging restriction process, however, does not have sufficient information on the exact use of substances in packaging.\n\n#### **Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:**\n\nThis reattribution ensures maximal synergies and coherence of scientific opinions. The same process and the same scientific methodologies as in REACH will be used. The substances under scrutiny are the same or similar to those under REACH (and other legislation supported by ECHA) and REACH (and other ECHA) data and processes can be reused for packaging restriction dossier development and opinion forming. All needed competencies for the task exist in ECHA.\n\n#### **Projected impact on ECHA**\n\n- ECHA Committees/bodies: **medium impact**. The task generates medium impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the additional use to be considered in the restriction\n\n|  | RAC                          |            |                    |  | SEAC                         |            |                    |  |\n|--|------------------------------|------------|--------------------|--|------------------------------|------------|--------------------|--|\n|  | # of<br>opinions<br>per year | rapporteur | Type of<br>opinion |  | # of<br>opinions<br>per year | rapporteur | Type of<br>opinion |  |\n\n| Restriction in packaging and packaging waste | 0 | RAC member | 0 | SEAC member |  |\n|----------------------------------------------|---|------------|---|-------------|--|\n|----------------------------------------------|---|------------|---|-------------|--|\n\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **medium impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks\n\n# **Projected workload and resource implications**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nN/A, no current process for hazardous substances.\n\n### Future workload and resource needs:\n\nIt can be expected that at most 1 restriction of a substance will be needed once per two years, i.e. 0.5 restriction per year. This would require 0.5 FTE per year. In addition, there is a need for the contribution of 15% for the development and maintenance of common IT components (0.1 FTE per year) and for the contribution of 15% for the horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): (0.1 FTE per year). In total, there is a need of 0.7 FTE per year. Considering the fact that these restrictions will be performed as REACH restrictions, possibly merging restriction in packaging with restriction of the same substance in another uses, the work resources can be covered by the available resources for REACH restriction.\n\nThe performing of the scoping study will require a dedicated person for 3 years to compile and analyse the necessary information leading to the identification and prioritisation of substances that need to be considered for the restriction in packaging. The work is the best to be performed by the large part by the internal ECHA staff as the access to all information on chemicals and materials is needed. It is estimated that 1 FTE for 3 years would be necessary to perform such study. Some subcontracting may be possible to get more information on the insight of the use of chemicals in packaging.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                      | Resource needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | - Processing at most 0.5 restriction dossiers per year (including RAC and SEAC opinion) as part of REACH restriction<br>- Performing a scoping exercise related to presence of chemicals in packaging | Financial resource needs:<br>2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0<br>Human resource needs:<br>2024: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2025: 1 TA, 0 CA<br>2026: 1 TA, 0 CA<br>2027: 1 TA, 0 CA<br>2028: 0 TA, 0 CA |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for packaging and packaging waste directive:\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n### **11.

Promote innovation, in particular for unmet medical needs, including for rare disease patients and children.\n- 2. Create a balanced system for pharmaceuticals in the EU that promotes affordability for health systems while rewarding innovation.\n- 3. Ensure access to innovative and established medicines for patients, with special attention to enhancing security of the supply across the EU.\n- 4. Reduce the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical product life cycle.\n- 5. Reduce the regulatory burden and provide a flexible regulatory framework.\n\nThe main requirements of the proposals to be met in the short and long term are:\n\n- Upon the entry into force of the Regulation, the Agency should put in place the framework which will be used to enhance regulatory support and accelerated assessment, to address medicine shortages and supply chain challenges and to strengthen the environmental risk assessment under the marketing authorisation.\n- Regarding the enhanced regulatory support, the Agency shall set up within 6 months of adoption a coordination mechanism to enable parallel scientific advice with health technology assessment and regulatory bodies for medical devices. Within the same period, the Agency shall create an\n\n<sup>53</sup> Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Union code relating to medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2009/35/EC (COM (2023) 192 final). <sup>54</sup> Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and establishing rules governing the European Medicines Agency, amending Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 and Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (COM (2023) 193 final).\n\n<sup>55</sup> EUR-Lex - 52023SC0191 - EN - [EUR-Lex \\(europa.eu\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=SWD%3A2023%3A0191%3AFIN)\n\n<sup>56</sup> EUR-Lex - 52023SC0192 - EN - [EUR-Lex \\(europa.eu\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=SWD%3A2023%3A0192%3AFIN)\n\n<sup>57</sup> EUR-Lex - 52023SC0193 - EN - [EUR-Lex \\(europa.eu\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=SWD%3A2023%3A0193%3AFIN)\n\nAcademia Office, a secretariat to support not-for-profit entities by providing them free of charge early scientific advice. Furthermore, the Agency shall establish an EU inspectorate within the Agency, to strengthen the network's inspection capacity and deal with emergencies, similar what was needed during the pandemic.\n\n- For addressing medicine shortages the Agency shall extend the monitoring and management capacity for all shortages, with a focus on critical shortages, and extend the EMA capacity to support would facilitate availability of critical medicinal products. This appropriate availability and access to medicinal products which may have a serious impact on public health.\n- The Agency shall also extend its capacity to support the enhanced environmental risk assessments.\n\nThe modified or new tasks that are related to the one substance, one assessment approach are:\n\n- developing coherent scientific assessment methodologies in the fields falling within EMA mission;\n- cooperating with EU decentralised agencies and other scientific authorities and bodies established under Union law, notably the European Chemicals Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Environment Agency as regards the scientific assessment of relevant substances, exchange of data and information and development of coherent scientific methodologies, including replacing, reducing or refining animal testing, taking into account the specificities of the assessment of medicinal products;\n- take the necessary and appropriate measures to monitor and identify at an early stage any potential source of divergence between its scientific opinions and the scientific opinions issued by other Union bodies and agencies carrying out similar tasks in relation to issues of common concern. Where the Agency identifies a potential source of divergence, it shall contact the body or agency in question to ensure that all relevant scientific or technical information is shared and in order to identify potentially contentious scientific or technical issues. Where a substantive divergence over scientific or technical issues is identified and the body concerned is a Union Agency or a scientific committee, the Agency and the body concerned shall cooperate to resolve the divergence, and inform the Commission without undue delay.\n- to enable coherence between scientific opinions and to avoid duplication of tests, EMA shall make arrangements with other bodies or agencies established under Union law for cooperation on scientific assessments and methodologies. EMA shall also make arrangements for the exchange of data and information on relevant substances with the Commission, Member States' authorities and other Union Agencies, in particular for environmental risk assessments, non-clinical studies and maximum residue limits. These arrangements shall seek to ensure that exchanges of data and information are made available in electronic formats and shall protect the commercially confidential nature of the information exchanged and be without prejudice to the provisions on regulatory protection.\n- electronic applications for marketing authorisations and for variations to the terms of the marketing authorisations shall be introduced to avoid unnecessary administrative and financial burden both for the pharmaceutical industry and the competent authorities and EMA shall make available such electronic formats.\n- EMA shall set-up an active substance based review system of environmental risk assessments ('ERA monographs') for authorised medicinal products. An ERA monograph shall include a comprehensive set of physicochemical data, fate data and effect data based on an assessment of active substances.\n\n**Proximity to Agency mandate:** The tasks fit well with the mandate of EMA as all three tasks target the areas of the EMA mandate, and they are either an expansion of existing tasks or addition of new tasks related to medicines.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:** Improving coherence, consistency and interoperability among the Agencies work is the key added value.\n\n# **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nThe new tasks require additional resources for EMA. The additional resource needs are mainly related to additional tasks to be carried out by EMA in terms of providing scientific, administrative and IT support in the following main areas:\n\n- enhanced pre-authorisation scientific and regulatory support;\n- decision-making on orphan designations and management of the Union Register of designated orphan medicinal products;\n- active substance master file assessment and certification;\n- inspection capacities for inspections in third countries and support to Member States;\n- environmental risk assessment strengthening;\n- shortage management and security of supply.\n\nAs described in the legislative financial statement accompanying the proposals, the following resources are needed:\n\n- 6 FTEs (4 AD and 2 AST TAs) are necessary to set up the Academia Office at EMA that will be managing the procedures. The tasks of the office will be similar to the tasks of the SME office and will include procedural and administrative assistance to \"not-for-profit\" entities, including direct assistance and briefing meetings on regulatory strategy, providing fee waivers and reductions to eligible entities, provide free-of-charge translations of the product information in all EU languages for initial EU marketing authorisations, provide training and education to \"not-for-profit\" entities, etc\n- 54 FTEs:\n  - o managing (AD profiles) and providing support (AST profiles) to operational expert groups in the area of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA);\n  - o with a scientific and regulatory profile to work in the shortages management and security of supply;\n  - o Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Clinical Practice inspectors (AD) necessary to establish an EU inspectorate resourced by EMA staff that would provide help to the inspections done by Member States (lacking resources), and deal with emergency situations which require dedicated and dependable intervention (e.g., similar to inspections required during the pandemic);\n  - o Legal officers (AD profiles), needed in the field of orphan designations that are already today a litigious topic and so it is assumed the proposed changes in the decision making on orphan designation would generate an increased in workload for even more legal queries and litigations;\n  - o defining business requirements for the data register, following up on the implementation and perform the related scientific activities when the register is live;, develop trainings on ERA, etc.;\n\n- o providing administrative support to the operational expert groups;\n- o working in the area of inspection planning;\n- o general assistants, assistants, supporting on procedural aspects or working on document creation.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for Medicinal Products Regulation:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks |                           |                                                                              |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EMA    | See above        | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0      |\n|        |                  | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 19 FTE<br>2025: 37 FTE<br>2026: 52 FTE<br>2027: 60 FTE<br>2028: 60 FTE |\n\nFuture budget line: DG SANTE (EU4Health programme) + EMA fees\n\n# **12. END-OF LIFE VEHICLES (ELV) DIRECTIVE**\n\n## **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of consultants\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** revision of the Directive on end-of-life vehicles (2000/53/EC)\n\n### **Type of task:** Existing\n\n### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Restriction of hazardous substances in end-of-life vehicles\n- 2. Assessments underpinning review of exemptions from restriction on lead, mercury, cadmium, or hexavalent chromium.\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\n### Current process:\n\nThe End-of-life Vehicle Directive bans the use of four heavy metals (lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) in vehicles put on the EU market after 1 July 2003. More substances could be prohibited, but in practice no substances have been added since the start of the directive. Annex II to the Directive lists the exemptions which allow the use of one of these heavy metals in specific applications where their use is \"unavoidable\". The only criteria used is availability of alternatives. Environmental and socio-economic aspects are not considered. The Commission reviews the exemptions on a regular basis based on technical and scientific progress and as the dates of exemption validity expire.\n\n1. Restricting (uses of) hazardous substances in vehicles: (~ REACH restriction):\n\n- Has not happened since the initial four heavy metals were placed on Annex II.\n- 2. Review of exemptions from the restrictions (~ REACH authorisation)\n  - Two years before the expiry date of an exemption, the Commission contracts a consultant to\n\nreview the existing exemptions. The contractor is used also for new exemptions. Next review is in 2025.\n\n- Contractor makes a review of the exemption needs [\\(example\\)](https://elv.biois.eu/ELV_11th_Adapt_Final_Report.pdf). The assessment focuses on determining whether the use of the substances in applications listed in Annex II is avoidable. The assessment includes stakeholder consultation.\n- Contractor concludes on whether the use of substances is avoidable and makes recommendation to the Commission.\n- The Commission consults a Commission expert group on the proposal, including MS and stakeholders.\n- The Commission drafts a delegated act, which is open for a 4-week commenting period, after which it adopts the delegated act amending Annex II.\n\n## Changes in the process: Yes\n\nAs part of the revision of the directive, the following changes are envisaged.\n\nThe scope of the Directive will be extended (from passengers' cars and light commercial vehicles) to include also motorbikes, buses, lorries, etc. As a result, higher workload is expected in terms of exemption requests.\n\nRestricting (uses of) new hazardous substances in vehicles will be done via REACH regulation, similarly as proposed for packaging and packaging waste directive.\n\nECHA will be tasked to assess the need for exemptions for existing restrictions (4 heavy metals).\n\nThe criteria for exemptions from restriction of 4 heavy metals will be amended to be similar to the socio-economic assessment and analysis of alternatives performed under REACH. The only criterion currently used is availability of alternatives. Environmental and socio-economic aspects are not considered. This is criticised, so better alignment with assessments as done under REACH is envisaged.\n\nRestrictions of use of chemicals in batteries used in vehicles will not be within the scope of the directive. This is to be addressed under the Batteries Regulation (as lex specialis).\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** All new restrictions of substances in vehicles will be done via the restriction process under REACH and the existing scientific methodologies used for REACH restrictions can be applied. The ELV exemption process will become very similar to the authorisation process under REACH, including the criteria for assessment. The substances under scrutiny are the same or similar to those under REACH and existing ECHA data and processes can be reused for ELV restriction dossier development, exemption process and opinion forming. ECHA holds the appropriate competences to manage the process, however, does not have sufficient information on the exact use of substances in end-of-life vehicles.\n\n| Type                     | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already supports similar work on<br>substance restrictions and exemptions under REACH and other<br>legislation.

The number of restrictions can be expected to be approximately 1 restriction per 5 years, i.e. 0.2 restriction per year.\n\nAssessment of the exemptions under the new REACH restriction will be done as part of the REACH process and review of REACH restrictions.\n\nAssessment and review of exemptions from existing restrictions for 4 metals (cadmium, mercury, led and chromium VI) will be in the future done by ECHA with involvement of SEAC committee. The assessment criteria will be extended as compared to today to be aligned with the criteria used under the REACH authorisation process. The scope of the directive will be extended to cover more types of vehicles, which will result in higher number of exemption requests as compared to today. The number of assessments of exemption is expected to be double as compared to today, i.e. 4.28 assessments per year.\n\nThe ELV restriction process is to be similar to REACH restrictions, with an average cost in ECHA of 1 (light) – 1.5 (complex) FTE per restriction dossier. The ELV restrictions are expected to be light dossiers.\n\nThe exemption review process is assumed similar to REACH applications for authorisations (AfA = 0.15 (light dossier) – 0.3 (complex dossier) FTE per application. The ELV assessments are expected to be light dossiers.\n\nThe resources needed for ECHA are as follow:\n\n- Development of 1 restriction dossier every 5 years (scope extension to new vehicle types)+ opinion forming: 0.2 FTE (~1 light REACH restriction = 1 FTE). However, considering that these restrictions will be performed as REACH restrictions, these resources can be covered by the available resources for REACH restriction. Therefore, for this part of work it is 0 FTE.\n- Review of up to 5 existing exemptions annually + SEAC opinion forming: 0.75 FTE (~unit cost of 1 light REACH application for authorisation = 0.15 FTE)\n- Scientific support services: substance identification and prioritisation, data management and dissemination: can be absorbed by the agency\n- IT tool development cost (data submission, processing, output): contribution of 15% for common components (0.11 FTE)\n- Horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): contribution of 15% (0.11 FTE)\n\n# Total: 0.97 FTE\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                   |                           |                                                                                                       |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Preparation of 1 restriction dossier every 5<br>years<br>Assessment of up to 5 exemptions per year | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                                              |\n|        |                                                                                                    | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 TA, 0 CAs<br>2025: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2027: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2028: 1 TA, 0 CAs |\n\nSummary of resource needs for end-of-life vehicle directive:\n\n### Future budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for funding from fees: Task 1 No, Task 2 yes\n\n### **13. TOY SAFETY DIRECTIVE**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of the SCHEER Committee\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** revision of the Toy safety directive (2009/48/EC).\n\n#### **Type of task:** existing\n\n#### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Assessment underpinning establishing or strengthening chemical limit values in toys for children under 36 months or toys for other children intended to be taken in the mouth;\n- 2. Assessment underpinning amending the limit values for 'heavy metals' in toys;\n- 3. Assessment underpinning amendments to the lists of allergenic fragrances that are prohibited in toys or that have to be labelled if present in toys;\n- 4. Assessment underpinning a derogation for the use of CMR substances in toys.\n\n#### **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nTasks 1, 2 and 3:\n\nThe process can be triggered by an expert of the subgroup Chemicals (which is a subgroup of the Expert Group on Toys Safety (01360) consisting of experts from the Member States, EEA-EFTA countries, the toy industry, the European consumer organisations ANEC) suggesting that a new or strengthened limit value for a chemical substance is needed, for example due to new scientific knowledge. Also a Scientific Committee opinion, such as from the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), may be a basis for the Commission services to propose a new/strengthened limit value;\n\nOnce the process is triggered, the subgroup Chemicals discusses the possible occurrence of the substance in toys, assesses the hazard, exposure and risk and recommends a limit value for toys below which the substance presents no risk. In case of conflicting views in the subgroup Chemicals that cannot be resolved, the Commission asks the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) to assess the hazard, exposure and risk, and to recommend a limit value for toys that presents no risk.\n\nOn the basis of the above recommendation, the Commission services draft a Directive amending the Toy Safety Directive, Appendix C. The draft Directive indicates in its recitals the occurrence of the chemical substance and suggests test methods for the substance in toys and toy materials. The Commission consults the proposal with the Expert Group on Toy Safety (consisting of experts from the Member States, EEA-EFTA countries, Candidate Countries, Switzerland, the toy industry, European consumer organisations (ANEC, BEUC), CEN, Cenelec, notified bodies). After the consultation, the Commission adopts the proposal via the comitology procedure.\n\n# Task 4:\n\nThe process is usually triggered by a toy industry expert, suggesting a derogation to allow the continued use of a CMR substance (Cat. 1A, 1B or 2) in toys. This occurs when a substance has been newly classified as being CMR.\n\nThe subgroup Chemicals briefly discusses the derogation and the Commission services requests the toy industry for an analysis of alternatives in the case substance is a CMR cat 1 A or 1B ( no analysis is necessaryif the substance is Cat. 2).\n\nThe Commission services then mandate the SCHEER to assess the use of the CMR substance in toys. To allow the Commission to grant a derogation, the SCHEER has to assess the use of the CMR in toys as safe. The Commission services also check whether REACH does not prohibited the CMR substance in consumer articles.\n\nIf the use of the CMR substance in toys is concluded by SCHEER to be safe, there is no prohibition of the substance in the consumer articles under REACH and the industry provides the analusis of alternatives when necessary, the Commission services draft a Directive amending the Toy Safety Directive, Appendix A. Then the Commission consults with the Expert Group on Toy Safety and adopts the proposal.\n\n# Changes envisaged as part of reattribution: Yes\n\nWith the revision, the Commission intends to introduce the following changes:\n\n- extending the generic assessment approach (automatic ban) to other hazard classes for the most harmful chemicals such as endocrine disrupting chemicals;\n- the possibility to introduce specific limit values for new chemicals could be introduced in all toys, and not only in toys intended for children under 36 months or to be put in the mouth, as is the case today.\n- Transfer the risk assessment tasks from SCHEER committee to ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC).\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The task is closely related to ECHA's core mandate and ECHA has the needed data, competences and expertise to perform the task.\n\n| Type                     | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already performs similar work on restrictions, derogations, setting of limit values and assessing socio-economic impacts under REACH and other legislation.

These opinions were about 17 substances and dealt with setting or reviewing limit values (3 opinions for 13 substances), 2 generic assessments and 2 derogations requests:\n\n- 2021: limit values for 8 substances in squishy toys\n- 2017: limit value for 1 substance\n- 2016: 1 generic opinion\n- 2015: limit value for 1 substance\n- 2012: 3 opinions (including 2 limit values and 1 derogation)\n- 2010: 3 opinions (including 1 limit value and 1 derogation request)\n\nThe secretariat of the scientific committees hosted by DG SANTE employs 4 FTE of DG SANTE and 2 additional FTEs of external interim staff (for technical and administrative support like literature search, editing and proofreading of opinions, website mastering, assistance for the Health-EU newsletter, dissemination activities). The staff of 6 FTEs is equally split over two committees, which means that 3 FTEs are used to support work of SCHEER. The workload of SCHEER dedicated to support of toys safety directive amounts to 10% of its time, which makes 0.3 FTE.\n\nThe operational costs for two committees (that includes special indemnities, accommodation, daily allowances, travel costs, reimbursement for rapporteurship, etc) operated by the Commission were EUR 2 883 030 for 6 years (2016-2021), which makes it approximately EUR 240 000 per year per committee. It must be noted that the operational costs in 2019 were EUR 340 000, which then went down because of the pandemic measures. The workload of SCHEER dedicated to support of toys safety directive amounts to 10% of its time, which corresponds to operational costs of EUR 24 000 (or at higher level of 2019 to EUR 34 000).\n\nThe resource use can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG GROW                     | Ca. 1 FTE (dedicated to the work on hazardous substances) |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| DG SANTE SCHEER secretariat | Ca. 0.3 FTE (10% of workload of SCHEER secretariat)       |\n| SCHEER committee            | 10% of membership capacity                                |\n|                             | Operation costs EUR 24 000/ year                          |\n| Total                       | Ca. 1.3 FTE                                               |\n\n*(to convert the cost of consultants into FTEs, the cost of 1 FTE consultant is estimated at ca. EUR 66 000 annually)*\n\nSuch Commission resources do not include contributions to the administrative overhead of the Commission (HR, Finance, IT tools, etc.).\n\n# Future workload and resource needs:\n\nWith the revision, the Commission intends to introduce the following changes:\n\n- extending the generic assessment approach (automatic ban) to endocrine disrupting chemicals;\n- the possibility to introduce specific limit values for new chemicals could be introduced in all toys, and not only in toys intended for children under 36 months or to be put in the mouth, as is the case today.\n\nFurthermore, currently CMRs are still allowed in toys up to the relevant CLP concentration limits. Beyond those, derogations can be requested. Only a few derogations were requested by industry in the past. If the generic prohibition would be extended from CMRs to EDC (or maybe even other hazard classes), then also new derogation requests could be expected, especially in the early years when production processes have not yet been adapted and EDCs are still present in potentially quite large amounts. Due to this, it can be reasonably expected that the workload for derogations will multiply (assumption x10 in the first years), but still within reasonable limits (e.g. 2 requests annually vs 2 requests in 10-12 years).\n\nThe main work related to limit value setting can be best compared to CLH work, which is currently rated at 0.5 FTE per substance per year within ECHA.\n\nThe processing of derogation requests is assumed similar to REACH applications for authorisations (AfA = 0.15 – 0.3 FTE / application).\n\nThe resource needs for ECHA would then be as follow:\n\n- Setting/reviewing limit values for 2 substances every year + scientific committee opinion forming: 1.0 FTE annually (~unit cost of 1 CLH opinion = 0.5 FTE)\n- Restriction/prohibition of 1 substance or generic opinion development for 1 substance/subject every 5 years + scientific committee opinion forming: 0.3 FTE annually (~unit cost of 1 REACH restriction = 1 – 1.5 FTE)\n- Review of 2 derogation requests annually + scientific committee opinion forming: 0.3 FTE (~unit cost of 1 REACH application for authorisation = 0.15 – 0.3 FTE)\n\n- Scientific support services: substance identification and prioritisation, data management and dissemination: can be absorbed by the agency\n- IT tool development cost (data submission, processing, output): contribution of 15% for common components (0.24 FTE)\n- Horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): contribution of 15% (0.26 FTE)\n\n# Total: 2 FTEs\n\n-----------\n\nSummary of resource needs for toy safety directive:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                           |                                                                                                            |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Assessment underpinning chemical limit values<br>Assessment underpinning amending the limit<br>values for 'heavy metals' in toys;<br>Assessment underpinning amendments to the lists<br>of allergenic fragrances that are prohibited in toys<br>Assessment underpinning a derogation for the useof CMR and EDs substances in toys. | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                                    |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2025: 2 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2026: 2 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2027: 2 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2028: 2 TAs, 0 CAs |\n\n#### Future budget line: DG GROW\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n### **14. RESTRICTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE (ROHS) DIRECTIVE (2011/65/EU)**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of consultants\n\n#### (Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Directive amending the RoHS Directive on reattribution of tasks to ECHA\n\n#### **Type of task:** Existing\n\n#### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Assessments underpinning restrictions of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (currently 10 restricted substances)\n- 2. Review of applications for exemptions from the restrictions.\n\n#### **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nRoHS restricts the use of hazardous substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE). It covers the placing on the market of articles. It does not cover the use of the substance during the manufacture of them. The restricted substances are included in Annex II to the Directive. They are identified in accordance with the criteria outlined in its Article 6(1) with priority given to substances included in Annexes XIV or XVII to REACH, Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) and substances with detrimental effects on waste management. RoHS includes also provisions for granting temporary exemptions for specific applications under certain conditions pursuant to Article 5. Applications exempted from the restrictions are included in Annex III and IV. The details of the processes are:\n\n1. Restricting hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (similar to REACH restriction):\n\n- The process is initiated by the Commission on its own initiative or following submission of a proposal by MSs (Art 6(1)).\n- Consultants perform a prioritisation to select substances.\n- Consultants perform an in-depth assessment (determination of hazard profile + waste management issues + also some basic socio-economic assessment; it includes consultation of interested parties).\n- Consultants make a recommendation whether the substance should be listed.\n- The Commission drafts delegated act modifying Annex II (currently listing 10 substances with their maximum concentration values).\n\n2. Reviewing exemptions from the restrictions (similar to REACH authorisation)\n\n- Industry applies for the exemption (new, renewal or revocation). Exemptions are by technical application.\n- Consultants evaluate the request for derogation and its justification vis-à-vis the conditions provided in Article 5(1)(a). It includes consultation of interested parties.\n- Consultants make recommendation whether a derogation shall be granted (and for how long).\n- The Commission adopts a delegated act modifying the Annexes III or IV.\n\n# Changes envisaged as part of reattribution: Yes\n\nThe Commission wishes to establish a Registry of intentions. It also wishes to address the current criticism on the process with regard to lack of transparency, predictability of duration of the processes and of the procedural steps, involvement of stakeholders, quality of the assessment process and required time. Alignment with other chemicals legislation is also desired.\n\n**Proximity to agency's mandate:** The RoHS restriction process, although not identical, is similar to the REACH restriction process and the similar scientific methodologies can be applied. The RoHS exemption process, although not the same, resembles the authorisation process under REACH. The substances under scrutiny are the same or similar to those under REACH and existing ECHA data and processes can be reused for RoHS restriction dossier development, exemption process and opinion forming. ECHA holds the right competences to manage the process, however, does not yet have sufficient information on the exact use of substances in electronic equipment.\n\n### **Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:**\n\n| Type                     | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already supports similar work on<br>substance restrictions and exemptions under REACH and other<br>legislation.

The task generates major impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the additional workload. The major impact is on SEAC committee.\n\n|             | RAC                    |            |                 | SEAC                   |             |                 |\n|-------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|             | # of opinions per year | rapporteur | Type of opinion | # of opinions per year | rapporteur  | Type of opinion |\n| Restriction | 1                      | RAC member |                 | 1                      | SEAC member |                 |\n| Exemptions  | 3                      | RAC member |                 | 30                     | SEAC member |                 |\n\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks. The end of life of an electrical and electronic equipment is important in this work and the expertise will need to be built in this area.\n\n# **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\n### Current workload and resource use:\n\nCurrently, there are 10 restricted substances. When the first directive was adopted in 2003, 6 substances were restricted. The 2011 revision of the directive introduced an obligation on the Commission to review and amend the list of restricted substances at the latest by July 2014 and periodically thereafter. In the first review, the Commission with the help of a consultant assessed 5 substances out of which four were added to the list of restricted substances in 2015 (Recital 10). The second review was launched in 2018 and assessed 7 substances (/groups), out of which 2 were recommended to be restricted. They have not been added to the list yet, as for one substance there is an assessment undergoing under the Stockholm Convention. Based on this information (12 substances (/groups) assessed in 12 years (2011 - 2023)), the current average workload can be estimated to be as 1 assessment of a chemical per year.\n\nThe second review which assessed 7 substances was supported by an external consultant contracted by DG ENV. The cost of the contract was ca. EUR 180 000 and it took 2 years. As the assessments are to be done ca. every 5 years, this indicates the current resources used for external support to be approximately 2.7 FTEs (EUR 180 000/66 000) for 7 substances for 5 years, i.e. 0.54 FTE annually.\n\nThere are 45 time-limited use exemptions (Annex III) and 48 exempted uses in medical devices or monitoring and control instruments (Annex IV) as current number entries. Each number entry however can cover several final applications, which can be categorised in different EEE categories (Annex I). Depending on the expiry date, exemptions can have up to four sub-entries for four groups of categories. By including these sub-entries, there are 238 valid exemptions (Status March 2023). In addition, a handful of exemption requests were assessed but no exemption was granted due to failure to meet the criteria.\n\nThe number of completed exemption evaluations, resulting in a published report, and the corresponding amount of resources required for external support varied depending on the year (see table below). Due to expiry dates of existing exemptions, there are many applications and evaluations in certain years. On average, in the period between 2015 and 2022, there were 13.9 exemptions evaluated per year.\n\n|--|\n\n| Number of exemptions evaluated (date of publication of study) | 2 | 38 | 4 | 11 | 2 | 9 | 0 | 45 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---|----|---|----|---|---|---|----|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---|----|---|----|---|---|---|----|\n\nThe number and complexity of exemptions requests increased over the years and it created a backlog on evaluating exemption request and adopting respective individual delegated directives. The corresponding resources spent for external support for assessments of exemption requests in the years 2017-2022 were ca. EUR 145 000 per year (on average), or ca. EUR 12 000 per exemption assessment, or 2.2 FTEs per year (EUR 145 000/66 000) or 0.18 FTE per exemption assessment (EUR 12 000/66 000).\n\nThe current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG ENV (for overall RoHS implementation)              | Ca. 1.5 FTE (on average)                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DG ENV consultants – support for restrictions         | Ca. 0.54 FTE annually (a contract of EUR 180 000 on<br>average each 5 years for reviewing restrictions)                                                |\n| DG ENV consultants – support for exemption evaluation | Ca. 2.2 FTE annually (contract for EUR 145 000<br>annually (average from 2017-2022) for outsourcing the<br>technical evaluation of exemption requests) |\n\n*(to convert the cost of consultants into FTEs, the cost of 1 FTE consultant is estimated at ca. EUR 66 000 annually)*\n\nIt must be noted that these resource estimates do not include contributions to the administrative overhead of the Commission (HR, Finance, IT tools, etc.). It must be also noted that the resources spent by the Commission were not sufficient, leading to the accumulation of requests for exemptions without processing them to the legal drafting (currently 61 exemptions pending) and the revision of the restriction was delayed (the review not finalised although it has started in 2018). There were also complaints about the quality and robustness of the assessments, the transparency of the process and involvement of stakeholders.\n\nCurrent budget line: DG Environment\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nRestrictions can be proposed by Member States and Commission has a duty to periodically review the list of restricted substances. It is expected that the number of restrictions and underlying assessments will be the same as in the past, *i.e.* assessment of ca. 1 chemical per year.\n\nRequests for exemptions are submitted by industry. As exemptions are time-bound, the workload volume is determined by the number of exemptions already in place and new requests coming in. When a new restriction is introduced, it leads temporarily to higher number of requests.\n\nIn the near future it is expected that the number of exemption requests will increase as compared to the past because in the past one exemption, which can be relevant for different final applications, had one expiry date regardless of their final application (e.g. in medical devices). With the introduction of splitting exemption entries depending on their final application, one previous exemption entry can have now several different expiry dates. That means, the number of exemption requests can be multiplied provided there are different final applications and the industry is applying for renewal. In addition, in order to narrow down the scope of exemptions, exemptions are more and more split in more specified sub-exemptions, which should narrow down the covered applications and allow more specific decisions.\n\nNot all exemptions are applied for renewal, but economic operators can submit also new exemption requests. It is expected that in the period of 2024-2025 there will be ca. 30 exemption requests per year to be evaluated – provided recommended exemptions with respective expiry date will be included.\n\nFor the future, the Commission (and stakeholders) also wishes to improve the procedure as regards transparency (establishment of a registry of intent), involvement of stakeholders, the level of scrutiny by the experts, robustness of the advice, independence of the advice and ensuring coherence with the assessments performed under the other pieces of legislation. This will increase the need for resources per exemption as compared to the past, but it is inevitable to address the concerns raised by the stakeholders and to ensure robustness and acceptance of the process.\n\nTo evaluate specific exemption requests, ECHA might still require external expertise from time to time (e.g. for assessing specific information about electronics). At the beginning, the need for external expertise may occur more frequently than at a later stage when experience has already been gained (e.g. with re-occurring renewal requests). However, it is expected that consulting external experts remains the exception. In addition, there will be a need to implement the procedure (e.g. by updating the guidance document for applications for an exemption). These irregular tasks depend on needs at that specific moment and they are predestined to be carried out by external consultants. In order to allow such ad-hoc tasks in the future, an operational budget is needed.\n\nThe future RoHS restriction process is assumed to be similar to REACH restrictions, with an average cost in ECHA of 1 (light dossier) – 1.5 (complex dossier) FTE / restriction dossier. As it is expected that in average there will be a need for 1 restriction dossier per year and the restriction dossiers will be likely light, it is estimated that there would be a need for additional 1 FTE per year.\n\nThe future process for assessing exemption requests is assumed to be similar to REACH applications for authorisations (~ AfA = 0.15 (light dossier) – 0.3 (complex dossier) FTE / application). It is expected that the RoHS exemption assessments are to require light assessment, thus 0.15 FTE per application. In addition, it is expected that RAC is consulted in 10% of the exemption applications and the work is estimated with 0.1 FTE per exemption. However, this additional resources for RAC can be absorbed by the Agency as part of the synergies with other work. In combination with the average of expected exemption requests (*i.e.* 30 exemptions per year), this would result in 4.5 FTEs per year.\n\nThe following resource estimates correspond to the \"ECHA way\", i.e. implementing similar processes and similar level of digitalisation to what is in place for ECHA's current tasks. Such examples would be the creation of registries of intentions and the dissemination of lists (exemptions, restrictions) as structured data.\n\n- Development of 1 restriction dossier annually + opinion forming by RAC and SEAC: **1 FTE** (~ unit cost of 1 REACH restriction = 1 (light) to 1.5 FTE (complex))\n- Review of 30 exemption applications annually + opinion forming of SEAC and for 10% of cases also by RAC: **4.5 FTEs**\n- Scientific support services: substance identification and prioritisation of candidate substances, data management and dissemination: to be absorbed by the Agency\n- IT tool development cost (industry and authority data submission, processing, output): contribution of 15% for development and maintenance of common components (**0.8 FTE**)\n- Horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): contribution of 15% (**0.8 FTE**)\n- Add-hoc support by external consultants (e.g. specific expertise): **EUR 66 000** in the first\n\n#### year and **EUR 33 000** in average in the following years.\n\n| Process                                            | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Estimated workload volume         | ECHA resource need                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Restriction of substances in electronic appliances | - Substance prioritisation and data analytics<br>- Restriction dossier development (ECHA secretariat)<br>- Conformity check<br>- Public/targeted consultation<br>- Committee opinion development (incl. support by secretariat)<br>- Data dissemination | 1 additional restriction per year | 7 FTEs<br>(including IT tool development and administrative overhead) |\n| Exemption requests                                 | - Industry dossier intake<br>- Completeness check<br>- Public consultation<br>- Committee opinion development (incl. support by secretariat)<br>- Support COM during adoption of the IA<br>- Data dissemination                                         | 30 exemption requests / year      |                                                                       |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) directive:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                           | Resource needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | - restriction of substances in electronic and electrical equipment (ca. 1 dossier per year)<br>- assessment of exemption request (30 assessments per year) | Financial resource needs:<br>2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 66 000<br>2026: EUR 33 000<br>2027: EUR 33 000<br>2028: EUR 33 000<br><br>Human resource needs:<br>2024: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2025: 3 TA, 0 CA<br>2026: 4 TA, 3 CA<br>2027: 4 TA, 3 CA<br>2028: 4 TA, 3 CA |\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: Yes, for assessment of exemptions\n\n### **15. POPS REGULATION (2019/1021)**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of consultants\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EEA\n\n#### **Legal basis for reattribution:** Omnibus regulation for reattribution of tasks\n\n**Type of task:** existing\n\n#### **Brief task overview:**\n\n1. Assessments underpinning setting concentration limit values for substances subject to waste\n\nmanagement provisions as part of the review of Annexes IV and V of the POPs regulation\n\n2. Receiving chemical monitoring data of POPs as part of the regular reporting under the POPs regulation\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n# Current process:\n\n# *Task 1*\n\nFor a substance added to Annex I (prohibition on manufacturing, placing on the market and use), Annex II (list of substances subject to restrictions) and as appropriate also for substances in Annex III (list of substances subject to release reduction provisions), limit values in Annex IV and V for these substances contained in waste need to be set, in order to ensure the environmentally sound management of waste consisting of or contaminated by this POP substance.\n\nThe concentration limit values set for waste containing POP substances directly affects the amounts of the concerned waste stream that can potentially be recycled, rather than being disposed of; a stricter limit value could even result in the cessation of recycling of the waste stream altogether. These limits are also very important in determing the possible disposal routes for waste (e.g. disposal in nonhazardous or hazardous waste landfills instead of incineration, admission in different types of incineration or co-incineration facilities. All these have relevant economic consequences for operators.\n\nTwo concentration limits are distinguished for POPs in waste:\n\n- Low POP concentration limit (Annex IV): defines the concentration limit above which POPs content in waste shall be subject to destruction or irreversible transformation; this means the waste cannot be recycled and disposal options are limited to certain treatments (possible exceptions can be granted by Member States for certain wastes)\n- Maximum POP concentration limit (Annex V): defines the threshold above which no derogation from the obligation to destroy or irreversibly transform the POP content can be granted\n\nThe need to act is triggered by inclusion of a substance in the Stockholm Convention, following which the process is initiated by the Commission: approx. 2-3 substances are identified as POPs under the Stockholm Convention every 2 years, but for the transposition into the POPs Regulation the Commission acts in five year cycles due to the heavy ordinary legislative procedure to add substances to Annexes IV and V of the POPs Regulation.\n\nFor existing limit values in Annex IV and V no standard review process exists, but the values need to be kept up to date in view of scientific and technical progress and revision clauses contained in the Regulation, for substances already listed, need to be observed.\n\nUnder the current practice, consultants perform a technical assessment (hazard, risk, socioeconomic aspects) for setting concentration limit values of the substance(s) in waste. This includes:\n\n- Collection of data on hazard and risk of the substance: this is mostly taken from the Stockholm Convention listing exercise of the substance;\n- Compilation of information for identification of presence and concentrations of the substance in different waste streams, and on recycling and other waste treatment activities involving waste containing this substance(s), followed by an analysis of the information. Starting from reported uses of this substance in products and articles and their material flows this includes a targeted stakeholder consultation (Member States and other relevant stakeholders in particular waste operators and users of recycled materials)\n- Application of an existing risk assessment methodology plus a socio economic assessment (no full socio-economic impact assessment) already developed by a consultant and applied in the past\n\n(not legally binding) regarding the implications on waste management of possible limit values for the substance in Annexes IV and V: different secenarios for delimination of the concentration range for a limit value are developed based on the application of lower and upper limitation criteria:\n\n- Lower limitation criteria:\n  - Limit values must be controlable analytically,\n  - Limit values should be above existing environmental background contaminations,\n  - the new required capacities for waste recovery and disposal are realistically available, and\n  - required additional waste management costs are economically reasonable\n- Upper limitation criteria:\n  - Limit values should not conflict with existing limit values\n  - Avoidance of adverse effects on HH (general population plus workers) and ENV\n- Based on the analysis of the impacts for different options of the limit values provided by the contractor, the Commission (DG ENV) develops an impact assessment for the options of the limit values and decides on the preffered option. The impact assessemnt is scrutinised by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board;\n- After the positive opinion of the regulatory scrutiny board, the Commission makes a proposal for amendment of Annexes IV or V\n- The proposal is submitted to the ordinary legislative procedure that is followed from the Commission side by DG ENV.\n\n# *Task 2*\n\nArticle 10 requires the Commission, supported by ECHA, and Member States to establish or maintain, as appropriate, in close cooperation, appropriate programmes and mechanisms, consistent with the state of the art, for the regular provision of comparable monitoring data on the presence of substances as listed in Part A of Annex III in the environment. When establishing or maintaining such programmes and mechanisms, due account shall be taken of developments under the Protocol and the Convention. The Commission is also mandated to regularly assess the possible need for the mandatory monitoring of a substance listed in Part B of Annex III and empowered to move a substance form Part B of Annex III to Part A.\n\nAnnex III Part A currently contains polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Part B currently contains hexachlorobenzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorobenzene, hezachlorobutadiene and polychlorinated naphthalenes.\n\nArticle 13(1)(e) requires Member States to draw up and publish a report containing information on the presence of substances listed in Part A of Annex III in the environment, as compiled pursuant to Article 10.\n\nArticle 13(2) states that where a Member State shares the information referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 with the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring, this shall be indicated by that Member State in its report and the Member State shall be considered to have fulfilled its reporting obligations under that point. Where the information referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 is contained in the report of a Member State provided to ECHA, ECHA shall use the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring for compiling, storing and sharing that information.\n\n### Changes in the process: Yes\n\n*Task 1*\n\n• It is expected that ECHA prepares a report with a technical assessment (hazard, risk,\n\nsocioeconomic aspects) for setting concentration limit values of the substance(s) in waste and makes a proposal for the concentration limit values.\n\n- Some detailed elements of the exising risk and socio-economic assessment methodology used so far, especially as regards risk assessment used to determine upper limitation criteir based on human and environmental health impacts, may need to be critically assessed and updated by ECHA.\n- It is expected that ECHA's Committee for Socio-Economic Assessment (SEAC) provides an opinion on the report prepared by ECHA and on the concentration limit values proposed by ECHA.\n- The report and the opinion of SEAC is then transmitted by ECHA to the Commission. If significant divergence exists between the ECHA report and the SEAC opinion, ECHA submits to the Commission an explanation of the divergence.\n- Based on the ECHA report and SEAC opinion, the Commission drafts a proposal for a delegated act amending Annexes IV or V.\n- The procedure would be triggered on request of the Commission to ECHA; the request is expected to come as a follow up to the Stockholm Convention amendments.\n\n# *Task 2*\n\nAs part of the legislative proposal on data, the operation of the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring is to be incorporated into the operation of the Common Data Platform on Chemicals and hosting of the collected monitoring data shall be done by the Agencies according to their mandates. This means that EEA will host all monitoring data in the environment.\n\nTo reflect the change of the situation with hosting the data and operation of IPCHEM, there is a need to change the process in POPs regulation. Therefore, Member States can make the relevant data available to the European Envrionment Agency instead of the IPCHEM and when done so, the reproting obligatio under Article 13 (1)(e) shall be considered fulfilled. When ECHA receives such monitoring data, it shall provide it for hosting to EEA instead of IPCHEM.\n\nIt shoud be noted that proposal for revision of water legislation requires Member States to share with EEA all monitoring data in waters. When adopted and enforced, EEA would have practically all monitoring data in the environment and thus the reporting under POPs would be fulfilled.\n\n# **Proximity to Agencies' mandate:**\n\n*ECHA (Task 1):* Some aspects could be quite similar to that performed by ECHA under REACH restrictions (environmental and human health risk assessment + socio-economic analysis), although technical waste-related aspects need to be considered more (e.g. recycling targets and technical limitations).\n\n*EEA (Task 2):* The task of hosting chemical monitoring data in the environment is a key part of the EEA mandate and thus the new task fits very well with its mandate. The existing tools and practices can be reused.\n\n# **Projected synergies and added value of the reattribution:**\n\n*Task 1 (ECHA):*\n\n| Type                     | Synergies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High<br>Process and expertise: ECHA already supports other work under the<br>POPs Regulation and performs similar work on restrictions, setting<br>of limit values and assessing socio-economic impacts under REACH<br>and other legislation.

Commission and other stakeholders would benefit from ECHA's extensive knowledge on hazard and risk assessment as well as of socio-economic analysis; As production shifts from primary to secondary raw materials, it would be an opportunity for ECHA to better understand the related hazards and risks as substances/materials re-enter supply chains under REACH jurisdictions or, when this is not possible, are disposed of in an environmentally sound manner, as waste.\n\n*Task 2:* If and when the legislative proposal on revision of water legislation made in October 2022 will be adopted, there is an opportunity to completely abandon the reporting of monitoring data under the POP regulation as the data will be reported under new provisions of water legislation. There is a clear opportunity from consolidating the chemical monitoring data in the environment and humans in EEA.\n\n### **Projected impact on Agencies:**\n\n### *ECHA (Task 1):*\n\n• ECHA Committees/bodies: **medium impact.** The task generates medium impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the additional workload The task requires involvement of SEAC committee\n\n|                                              | RAC                    |            |                 |  | SEAC                   |            |                 |  |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------|--|------------------------|------------|-----------------|--|\n|                                              | # of opinions per year | rapporteur | Type of opinion |  | # of opinions per year | rapporteur | Type of opinion |  |\n| Setting waste limit values in Annex IV and V | 0                      |            |                 |  | 2                      | ECHA       |                 |  |\n\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks. New expertise will need to be built to cover waste management.\n\n# *EEA (Task 2):*\n\n- EEA Committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require involvement of EEA Committees/bodies\n- EEA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- EEA key experts: **low impact**. The task relies on the expertise that already exists in the agency.\n\n# **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n# Current workload and resource use:\n\nCurrently, there are 25 limit values for individual substances or groups of substances. The workload driver is adding substances to the Stockholm Convention (new POP is also new entry here). The experience shows that about 2 substances are added to Stockholm Convention every 2 years. Another workload driver are review clauses that are added to substances, usually to be reviewed after 5 years. This depends on the initiative of the Commission. Changes in exemptions may also influence the need for an Annex IV review (due to changes in Annex A or B of the Stockholm Convention), but not so often. For both, reviews and changes in exemptions, the workload is lower compared to developing limit values for new substances as all the basic work has already been done.\n\nFor the latest proposal to amend Annexes IV and V of the POP Regulation, COM (2021) 656 final, DG ENV used circa EUR 200 000 (but also relied on a preceding study of ca. EUR 100 000 covering hazard / risk aspects) for the support study for the impact assessment with proposals for limit values for 8 substances:\n\n- 3 new and recently listed substances to the Stockholm Convention\n- 1 substance that was under consideration by the POP Review Committee of the Convention as a candidate (and which was added to Annex I in June 2022)\n- 2 substances already listed in the Annex IV POP Regulation for review\n- 2 substances already listed in the Annex IV POP Regulation for adaptation to scientific and technical progress\n\n20 % of the budget for this support study was dedicated to the update of information on mass flows associated with the POP substances in question and their presence in waste (earlier reports already identified these mass flows). 60 % of the budget for this support study was dedicated to the (i) compilation of information in support of the IA, (ii) stakeholder consultation activities, (iii) comparative assessment of the impact for each concentration limit option and (iv) the proposal and justification of the low POP concentration limits for the 8 substances. One desk officer in DG ENV worked on this task 50% for 3 years, plus contractors 3 staff for 1 year. The final impact assessment was written by the DG ENV staff member. DG ENV staff involvement further includes process until adoption by the College (RSB submission, ISC, etc) and involvement in the co-decision process (multiple interactions with the Working Party for the Environment of the Council, interaction with MEPs and MEP assistants in the ENVI Committee and participation in trilogues).\n\nThe current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG ENV             | 0.5 FTE per year                                                                |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DG ENV consultants | 4.5 FTEs (EUR 300 000 for consultants) every<br>3 years (i.e. 1.5 FTE per year) |\n| <b>Total</b>       | <i>Ca.</i> 2.0 FTEs annually                                                    |\n\n*(to convert the cost of consultants into FTEs, the cost of 1 FTE consultant is estimated at ca. EUR 66 000 annually)*\n\nIt should be noted that such Commission resources do not include contributions to the administrative overhead of the Commission (HR, Finance, IT tools, etc.).\n\nCurrent budget line: DG Environment\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\n# *Task 1*\n\nIt is expected that the number of substances added to the Stockholm Convention will continue to be about 2 substances every 2 years, or 1 substance per year on average. Based on current review commitments established in review clauses in the POPs Regulation, it is expected that about 5 reviews of existing limit values will be necessary every 5 year, i.e. on average 1 review per year.\n\nThe Commission wishes to change the procedure for amendment of Annexes IV and V from ordinary legislative procedure to delegated act to reduce the administrative burden on the EU institutions and to make the procedure proportional to its impact.\n\nIn order to have a scrutiny of socio-economic impacts of the chosen limit values robust and of high quality, the Commission wishes to get an opinion of the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis on the proposed limit values, based on a prior ECHA report.\n\nThe process would be to some extent similar to REACH restrictions with limit values or to the setting the Occupation Exposure Levels, with an average cost in ECHA of 1 (light dossier) – 1.5 (complex dossier) FTE / restriction dossier, but only with the scrutiny by SEAC and not by RAC. The detailed resource needs estimation for ECHA is as follows:\n\n- On average there is a need to develop 1 new dossier every year + SEAC opinion forming: 1 FTE/year, as there is no involvement of RAC (because most of the hazard assessment work has been done already at the Stockholm Convention level and the unit cost of 1 REACH restriction are approximately 1 (light dossier) to 1.5 (complex dossier) FTEs)\n- Review of existing 5 substance limit values every 5 years, or on average 1 substance every year (at 50% effort of full new dossier) = 0.5 FTE / year\n- Scientific support services: substance identification and prioritisation, data management and dissemination: additional work to be absorbed by the Agency\n- IT tool development cost (data submission, processing, output): contribution of 15% for\n\ncommon components (0.25 FTE per year)\n\n• Horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): contribution of 15% (0.25 FTE per year)\n\n-----------\n\nTotal: 2 FTEs per year\n\n# *Task 2*\n\nThe reporting of chemicals monitoring data under POPs regulation will require no or only very minimal additional resources, as POPs monitoring data in waters are to be reported under the water legislation and resources for that were proposed, POPs monitoring data in air are already being reported to EEA as part of the air quality legislation and there are only very limited additional data sets in the environment, mainly in soil which is usually collected by JRC. In addition, hosting of any additional data sets in the environment is also covered in the resource for common data platform.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the POPs regulation:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Financial resource needs: 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 35 000<br>2026: EUR 50 000<br>2027: EUR 50 000<br>2028: EUR 50 000<br>Human resource needs: 2024: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2025: 1 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2026: 2 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2027: 2 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2028: 2 TAs, 0 CAs |\n| EEA    | Financial resource needs: 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0<br>Human resource needs: 2024: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2025: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2026: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2027: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2028: 0 TAs, 0 CAs                     |\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **16. MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATION**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of the SCHEER Committee\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for (re-)attribution:** Omnibus regulation for reattribution of tasks\n\n### **Type of task:** existing\n\n**Brief task overview:** (1) Preparation and review of the guidelines on how to perform the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of phthalates in medical devices; (2) Preparation and review of the guidelines on how to perform the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR and endocrinedisrupting substances in medical devices. (3) Ad hoc requests for opinion on safety of a chemical in medical devices (not part of the proposal but possible based on general clause in ECHA founding regulation).\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n# Current process:\n\nArticle 5 paragraph 2 of the Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices stipulates: \"A device shall meet the general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I which apply to it, taking into account its intended purpose.\" Accordingly, Section 10.4 of Annex I, which deals with substances in medical devices, states that \"Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way as to reduce as far as possible the risks posed by substances or particles, including wear debris, degradation products and processing residues, that may be released from the device.\" Particular substances of concern are those which (a) are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR), of category 1A or 1B, or (b) have endocrine-disrupting properties (ED).\n\nThe Regulation further states that:\n\n\"Devices, or those parts thereof or those materials used therein that:\n\n- are invasive and come into direct contact with the human body,\n- (re)administer medicines, body liquids or other substances, including gases, to/from the body, or\n- transport or store such medicines, body fluids or substances, including gases, to be (re)administered to the body\n\nshall only contain any such substance above the concentration of 0.1% weight by weight where justified pursuant to Section 10.4.2. The justification shall be based on several elements, including the latest relevant scientific committee guidelines, if applicable and available.\"\n\nSpecifically for phtalates, according to Section 10.4.3, the Commission shall provide a mandate to the relevant scientific committee to prepare such guidelines for phthalates which are subject to these provisions. These guidelines are explicitly requested by the Regulation to be available at the latest on the date of application of the Regulation, and are to be updated whenever appropriate on the basis of the latest scientific evidence, or at least every five years. In its latest guidelines of 2019, the SCHEER recommended that \"Pending on new scientific evidence, it is recommended to evaluate the use and usefulness of these Guidelines after an application period of three years.\"\n\nThe Regulation also includes the option for the Commission to mandate the relevant committee to prepare guidelines on other CMR and endocrine-disrupting substances, where appropriate.\n\nUpon request by DG SANTE, the guidelines and opinions are produced by the relevant committee (SCHEER). The process includes public consultation. Opinions are delivered to the Commission who publishes them. The list of recent SCHEER opinions is [https://health.ec.europa.eu/scientific](https://health.ec.europa.eu/scientific-committees/scientific-committee-health-environmental-and-emerging-risks-scheer/scheer-opinions_en)[committees/scientific-committee-health-environmental-and-emerging-risks-scheer/scheer](https://health.ec.europa.eu/scientific-committees/scientific-committee-health-environmental-and-emerging-risks-scheer/scheer-opinions_en)[opinions\\\\_en](https://health.ec.europa.eu/scientific-committees/scientific-committee-health-environmental-and-emerging-risks-scheer/scheer-opinions_en)\n\nThe first guideline on how to perform the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of phthalates in medical devices was prepared by SCHEER committee on request of the Commission in 2019. The guideline is available [here](https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-benefit-risk-assessment-presence-phthalates-certain-medical-devices_en) and an example of benefit/risk assessment opinion on a substance (DEHP) is available [here.](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_047.pdf)\n\nThere was no request for the preparation of the guidelines on how to perform the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR and endocrine-disrupting substances in medical device and no such guidelines exists.\n\nChanges in the process: Yes\n\nThe Commission would request ECHA to prepare or review the guidelines on how to perform the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMRs, endocrine disruptors and phthalates. The guideline would be developed or reviewed by ECHA secretariat and when appropriate or when requested by the Commission, ECHA will consult the Committee for Risk Assessment and the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis.\n\nThe process would follow a standardised procedure, including most likely the following steps:\n\n- The Commission issues the request for an opinion\n- Substance identification and prioritisation\n- Dossier preparation (by ECHA staff) with risk assessment, including\n  - o Hazard/risk assessment\n  - o Exposure assessment\n  - o Assessment of alternatives\n- Call for evidence/public consultation\n- Potentially RAC opinion development\n- Potentially SEAC opinion development\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The development of the guidelines on how to perform the risk-benefit analysis for the use of substances fits well with the mandate of ECHA, which develops various guidelines for industry for the implementation of REACH (e.g. guidelines on risk assessment of chemicals, guidelines on assessment of alternatives of chemicals, guideline on socio-economic assessment).\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA already provides scientific advice on<br>chemical substances, including on phthalates, endocrine disruptors<br>and CMRs under REACH and other legislation.

The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **medium impact**. The task relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks\n\n### **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use\n\nThe SCHEER Committee has worked on six chemical-related medical device opinions in the period 2014-2022 (i.e. average of 1 opinion every 2 years):\n\n| Medical Devices                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of phthalates in certain<br>medical devices covering phthalates which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to<br>reproduction (CMR) or have endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties | June 2019 |\n| Opinion on the safety of medical devices containing DEHP-plasticized PVC or                                                                                                                                                              | Feb 2016  |\n\n| other plasticizers on neonates and other groups possibly at risk                                               |           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Opinion on the safety of dental amalgam and alternative dental restoration<br>materials for patients and users | Apr 2015  |\n| Opinion on the safety of surgical meshes used in urogynaecological surgery                                     | Dec 2015  |\n| Opinion on the safety of the use of bisphenol A in medical devices                                             | Feb 2015  |\n| Opinion on the safety of Metal-on-Metal joint replacements with a particular focus<br>on hip implants          | Sept 2014 |\n\nThe DG SANTE Secretariat covers both SCCS and SCHEER tasks and consists of 4 FTE from the Commission staff + 2 FTE from an outsourced contract (EUR 250 000 annually) for technical and administrative support (literature search, editing and proofreading of opinions, website mastering, assistance for the Health-EU newsletter, dissemination activities), equally split over both committees. The SCHEER committee itself consists of 17 external experts. The advice on chemicals in medical devices can be roughly estimated to constitute ca. 10 % of the work of the SCHEER committee (4 out of 29 opinions during 2015-2022), which corresponds to ca. 0.3 FTE (10% of 3 FTEs from SCHEER secretariat).\n\nThe operational costs for two committees (that includes special indemnities, accommodation, daily allowances, travel costs, reimbursement for rapporteurship, etc) operated by the Commission were EUR 2 883 030 for 6 years (2016-2021), which makes it approximately EUR 240 000 per year per committee. It must be noted that the operational costs in 2019 were EUR 340 000, which then went down because of the pandemic measures. The workload of SCHEER dedicated to support of medical devices regulation amounts to 10% of its time, which corresponds to operational costs of EUR 24 000 (or at higher level of 2019 to EUR 34 000).\n\nThe DG SANTE medical device unit spends, according to its own accounts, 0.1 FTE annually on following up on such scientific opinions requested from SCHEER.\n\n| The current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows: |                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                             |                                                                                                            |\n| DG SANTE (policy unit)                                                      | 0.1 FTE per year                                                                                           |\n| DG SANTE (Committees unit, including external support)                      | 0.3 FTE (10% of the SCHEER secretariat)<br>Operational costs ca.

It will be still reviewed by the SCHEER committee, the work has started in April 2023. The next review will be due in 2029.\n\nThe Commission does not envisage in the near future asking for the guidelines on how to perform risk-benefit analysis of use of CMRs and ED in medical devices.\n\nECHA resource needs would be as follows:\n\n- Development of a guideline for performing risk-benefit assessment of the presence of phthalates in certain medical devices every 5 years, including, where requested or appropriate, scientific committee opinion forming: 0.2 FTE (~unit cost of 1 REACH restriction = 1 (light dossier) – 1.5 (complex dossier) FTE)\n- Development of a guideline for performing risk-benefit assessment on the use of CMR and endocrine-disrupting substances or other ad hoc mandate on chemicals in medical devices every 5 years: 0.2 FTE (~unit cost of 1 REACH restriction = 1 – 1.5 FTE)\n- Scientific support services: substance identification and prioritisation, data management and dissemination: contribution of 0.1 FTE based on the size of the task\n- IT tool development cost (data submission, processing, output): contribution of 15% for common components (0.1 FTE)\n- Horizontal support (governance & enablers / administrative overhead): contribution of 15% (0.1 FTE)\n\n-----------\n\n# Total: 0.7 FTEs\n\nConsidering that the envisaged frequency of the work is very low, the involvement of the Committees is only where necessary, the first work will likely materialise only in 2029, the work can be absorbed by the agency without any additional resources.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the medical devices regulation:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                        |                           |                                                                         |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | - Guideline on phthalates<br>- Guideline on CMRs or EDs | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0 |\n|        |                                                         | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 FTE<br>2025: 0 FTE<br>2026: 0 FTE<br>2027: 0 FTE<br>2028: 0 FTE |\n\n# Future budget line: DG SANTE\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **17. EEA FOUNDING REGULATION (1210/90)**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: EEA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: EEA, expanding the existing tasks\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** omnibus regulation on reattribution of task\n\n# **Type of task:** New\n\n# **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Developing methodologies for assessment related to chemicals in the fields falling within its mission\n- 2. Cooperating with other agencies as regards exchange of data, defining formats and controlled vocabularies and development of methodologies related to chemicals.\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n# Current process:\n\n*Task 1*\n\nEEA has some very specific tasks with some relevance to the development of methodologies mentioned in the current founding regulation. These are:\n\n(iv) to help ensure that environmental data at European level are comparable and, if necessary, to encourage by appropriate means improved harmonization of methods of measurement;\n\n(viii) to stimulate the development of methods of assessing the cost of damage to the environment and the costs of environmental preventive, protection and restoration policies;\n\n(xii) to support the Commission in the process of exchange of information on the development of Environmental Assessment methodologies and best practice;\n\nEEA however lacks the mandate and obligation to develop methodologies and for the assessment related to chemicals. This disadvantages the EEA as compared to other agencies.\n\n*Task 2*\n\nThe EEA founding regulation contains some provisions related cooperation. The Article 15 states:\n\n1. The Agency shall actively seek the cooperation of other Community bodies and programmes, and notably the Joint Research Centre, the Statistical Office and the Community's environmental research and development programmes. In particular:\n\n- − cooperation with the Joint Research Centre shall include the tasks set out in the Annex under A,\n- − coordination with the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the statistical programme of the European Communities will follow the guidelines outlined in the Annex under B.\n\n2. The Agency shall also cooperate actively with other bodies such as the European Space Agency, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Council of Europe and the International Energy Agency as well as the United Nations and its specialized agencies, particularly the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization and the International Atomic Energy Authority.\n\n2a. The Agency may cooperate in areas of common interest with those institutions in countries which are not members of the European Communities which can provide data, information and expertise, methodologies of data collection, analysis and assessment which are of mutual interest and which are necessary for the successful completion of the Agency's work.\n\n3. The cooperation referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 2a must in particular take account of the need to avoid any duplication of effort.\n\nThe Annex A to the regulation lists some areas for cooperation with JRC:\n\nA. Cooperation with the Joint Research Centre\n\n- − Harmonization of environmental measurement methods (1).\n- − Intercalibration of instruments (1).\n- − Standardization of data formats.\n- − Development of new environmental measurement methods and instruments.\n- − Other tasks as agreed between the Executive Director of the Agency and the Director-General of the Joint Research Centre.\n\nThe existing provisions do not give an explicit mandate nor obligation to EEA to cooperate with ECHA, EMA and EFSA in those areas. In order to achieve the one substance, one assessment ambition, it is necessary to strengthen the provisions on cooperation.\n\n# Future process:\n\n*Task 1:*\n\nEEA will have a mandate to develop methodologies for the assessments related to chemicals it performs and it will develop such methodologies based on its needs.\n\n# *Task 2:*\n\nEEA actively cooperates with ECHA, EFSA and EMA as regards:\n\n- exchange of data on chemicals and defining formats and controlled vocabularies for such data\n- development of methodologies related to chemicals,\n- operation of early warning system for chemicals\n- operation of framework of indicators of chemical policies\n\nThe cooperation is foreseen both ways, i.e. when EEA itself makes some development in those specified areas within its domain as well as when EFSA, ECHA and EMA make some development in those areas within their domains. The goal is to ensure coherence, consistency and interoperability in the specified areas.\n\n**Proximity to Agency mandate:** Both tasks fit well with the mandate of EEA as both tasks target the areas of the EEA mandate.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:** Improving coherence, consistency and interoperability among the Agencies work is the key added value.\n\n#### **Projected impact on EEA:**\n\n- EEA Committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not involve the committee/network.\n- EEA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- EEA key experts: **low impact**. The task relies on expert competencies, but the task is limited and spread over time in its nature.\n\n#### **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nThe work on the new tasks is limited and spread over time in it is nature. On a need basis, it requires that EEA will develop methodologies for the assessment it performs as regards chemicals. The development and setting the methodology is a standard practice for whoever performs the assessments, so this task can be seen as a formalisation of existing EEA work. There is no need for additional resources for this task.\n\nEEA will also need to cooperate with ECHA, EFSA and EMA in the areas on data, formats, methodologies, early warning system and indicator framework. The need for additional resources for cooperation on these are already covered under the legislative proposal on data (operation of common data platform, operation of early warning system and operation of indicator framework) and there is no need for additional resources on this general formal mandate for agency to cooperate.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for EEA founding regulation:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                      |                           |                                           |\n|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| EEA    | - Development of<br>methodologies for | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0 |\n\n| assessments related to<br>chemicals within its<br>missions<br>- Cooperation with ECHA,<br>EFSA, EMA on issues<br>related to chemical | Human resource needs: | 2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0<br>2024: 0 FTE<br>2025: 0 FTE<br>2026: 0 FTE<br>2027: 0 FTE<br>2028: 0 FTE |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **18. GENERAL FOOD LAW (178/2002)**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: EFSA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: EFSA, expanding and modifying the existing tasks\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** omnibus regulation on reattribution of task\n\n# **Type of task:** New\n\n### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Developing methodologies for assessment of chemicals in the fields falling within its mission\n- 2. Cooperating with other agencies as regards exchange of data, defining formats and controlled vocabularies, development of methodologies related to chemicals\n- 3. Preventing and solving divergent opinions on chemicals with ECHA and EMA\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\n### *Task 1*\n\nEFSA has a very clear tasks in Article 23 to promote and coordinate the development of uniform risk assessment methodologies in the fields falling within its mission. The mandate is sufficient and no change is required.\n\n### *Task 2*\n\nThe EFSA founding regulation contains some provisions related to cooperation. The Article 22 that defines the mission of EFSA states:\n\n7. The Authority shall carry out its tasks in conditions which enable it to serve as a point of reference by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of the opinions it issues and the information it disseminates, the transparency of its procedures and methods of operation, and its diligence in performing the tasks assigned to it. It shall act in close cooperation with the competent bodies in the Member States that carry out similar tasks to those of the Authority and, where appropriate, with the relevant Union agencies.\n\nThe existing provisions are rather general. In order to achieve the one substance, one assessment ambition, it is necessary to strengthen the provisions on cooperation.\n\n### *Task 3*\n\nEFSA founding regulation specifies provisions for preventing and solving divergent scientific opinions with other agencies. Article 30 states:\n\n- 1. The Authority shall exercise vigilance in order to identify at an early stage any potential source of divergence between its scientific opinions and the scientific opinions issued by other bodies carrying out similar tasks.\n- 2. Where the Authority identifies a potential source of divergence, it shall contact the body in question to ensure that all relevant scientific information is shared and in order to identify potentially contentious scientific issues.\n- 3. Where a substantive divergence over scientific issues has been identified and the body in question is a Community agency or one of the Commission's Scientific Committees, the Authority and the body concerned shall be obliged to cooperate with a view to either resolving the divergence or presenting a joint document to the Commission clarifying the contentious scientific issues and identifying the relevant uncertainties in the data. This document shall be made public.\n- 4. Where a substantive divergence over scientific issues has been identified and the body in question is a Member State body, the Authority and the national body shall be obliged to cooperate with a view to either resolving the divergence or preparing a joint document clarifying the contentious scientific issues and identifying the relevant uncertainties in the data. This document shall be made public.\n\nThe provisions need to be aligned with those for other agencies. In addition, there is a need to strengthen the requirement to solve the divergent view by agencies among themselves, before the matter is referred to the Commission to be solved.\n\n# Future process:\n\n# *Task 1:*\n\nThe existing mandate for development of methodologies is sufficient and no change is required.\n\n*Task 2:*\n\nEFSA actively cooperates with ECHA, EEA and EMA as regards:\n\n- exchange of data on chemicals and defining formats and controlled vocabularies for such data\n- development of methodologies related to chemicals,\n- operation of early warning system for chemicals\n- operation of framework of indicators of chemical policies\n\nThe cooperation is foreseen both ways, *i.e.* when EFSA itself makes some development in those specified areas within its domain as well as when EEA, ECHA or EMA make some development in those areas within their domains. The goal is to ensure coherence, consistency and interoperability in the specified areas.\n\n# *Task 3:*\n\nEFSA and body concerned shall first attempt to solve the divergent opinion on scientific or technical issues by themselves. They shall revert the decision to the Commission only if they were not able to solve the issue. In addition, if the divergence come from different hazard identification or characterisation, then the Commission shall request ECHA to prepare a proposal for harmonised classification under the CLP regulation.\n\n**Proximity to Agency mandate:** The tasks fit well with the mandate of EFSA as both tasks target the areas of the EFSA mandate, and they are just improvement of existing tasks.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:** Improving coherence, consistency and interoperability among the Agencies work is the key added value.\n\n# **Projected impact on EFSA:**\n\n• EFSA Committees/bodies: **low impact**. The task might require some ad hoc involvement of committee/panels or their consultation.\n\n- EFSA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- EFSA key experts: **low impact**. The task relies on expert competencies, but the task is limited and spread over time in its nature.\n\n# **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n#### Future workload and resource needs:\n\nEFSA will need to cooperate with ECHA, EEA and EMA in the areas on data, formats, methodologies, early warning system and indicator framework. The need for additional resources for cooperation on these are already covered under the legislative proposal on data (operation of common data platform) or they are already within the mandate of EFSA (early warning system). Consequently, there is no need for additional resources on this general formal mandate for Authority to cooperate.\n\nEFSA will need to try to solve any divergence in technical or scientific issue with the other agency. EFSA already has such obligation in the existing regulation. The new task will require that the agencies make more effort to solve the issue among themselves, instead of just forwarding the problem to the Commission. Although it might require slightly higher amount of work by the Authority as compared to today, such situations are rare and therefore this can be absorbed by the Authority without any additional resources.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                               |                           |                                                                         |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EFSA   | - Cooperation with ECHA, EFSA, EMA on issues related to chemical<br>- Preventing and solving divergent opinions or assessments | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0 |\n|        |                                                                                                                                | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 FTE<br>2025: 0 FTE<br>2026: 0 FTE<br>2027: 0 FTE<br>2028: 0 FTE |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for General Food Law regulation:\n\nFuture budget line: None\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **19. EU COMMON DATA PLATFORM ON CHEMICALS**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: N/A, no current process\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EFSA, EMA, EEA, EU-OSHA, JRCLegal basis for reattribution: Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n**Type of task:** new (new infrastructure but building on existing data and services)\n\n**Brief task overview:** Setting up and operation of the common data platform on chemicals.\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\nThe principal aim of this new IT infrastructure operating as part of the Green Deal Data Space is to support effective and coherent chemical safety assessments. It will provide integrated, userdifferentiated and highly functional access to chemicals-related datasets owned or managed by EU agencies and IPCHEM (see section 18 below) and provide space for dedicated services supporting EU chemicals policy and legislative implementation. Those dedicated services include the provision of information on the obligations under EU acts on chemicals (see section 23), a repository of reference values (see section 22), information on regulatory processes on chemicals (see section 21), information platform for chemical monitoring (see section 20) and the database on environmental sustainability related information on chemicals (see section 24). An integral aspect of the platform is its governance, ensuring continuous evolution and relevance through the inclusion of further functionalities, datasets and services (e.g. on academic studies) and ensuring support to the thriving ecosystem of services outside the platform.\n\n## Current process:\n\nA comprehensive assessment of the status of the chemicals data landscape was made in a feasibility study on a common open data platform58. There is a large amount of chemicals data in databases, much of it compiled following legal provisions and used in the regulatory processes but also disseminated by EU agencies and the Commission for transparency and public use. Comprehensive IT development has been taking place in the agencies, optimising tools applied to internal data within the sectors, at least in specific circumstances also using common building blocks (e.g. IUCLID for information on chemical hazards). IPCHEM (see section 20) has been developed for use across sectors but is limited to chemical occurrence data.\n\nEffective common access to different types of chemicals data across those solutions has however not been made available and is therefore also not systematically applied in EU chemicals assessments, also as any ad hoc integration is hampered by different conditions of use, differences in data formats and applied controlled vocabularies, not least for chemical substance identification.\n\nThere is inefficiency and duplication as individual projects repeat the same efforts merging and curating certain data across sectors for specific needs such as the validation of predictive tools. There is also a loss of coherence or there is even divergence between assessments of the same or similar substances or groups of substances due to differences in the datasets used.\n\n## Changes envisioned as part of setting up the common data platform\n\nThe feasibility study on a common open data platform on chemical safety data has already identified the steps needed to establish the platform and based on the input by various stakeholders identified a set of use cases that could be prioritised for the initial implementation of the platform, with the functionalities and datasets to be integrated. The work in the study has been validated by the experts responsible for the datasets considered for initial integration in the platform: a dedicated interservice team led by ECHA, identified as the appropriate host for the platform.\n\nThe team turned it into a practical 3-year development and operations roadmap, and quantified resources in the Project Initiation Document. It can be summarised around three main headlines:\n\n• design and construction of a **data container**: the technical platform solution and the data definitions and ingestion mechanisms that enable it to receive data. While ECHA is responsible for the IT infrastructure of the data container, cooperation (and – depending on the data type – lead) by the other agencies in setting the data definitions and supporting the general governance of the platform on aspects such as the determination of basic functionalities (ingestion, use and outputs, dedicated services featuring in the platform) and\n\n<sup>58</sup> [Feasibility study on a common open platform on chemical safety data -](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/0af584f7-79a5-11ec-9136-01aa75ed71a1/language-en) Publications Office of the EU (europa.eu)\n\nfurther evolution is essential.\n\n• The **data content** activities: data transformation, curation and confidentiality assessment. Upload of every integrated dataset will, while based on commonly agreed rules and vocabularies, and supported as appropriate with ingestion tools, remain the responsibility of the data source owners (i.e. agencies), unless explicitly agreed otherwise. For data source owners, this work will overlap with work on standard data formats and controlled vocabularies of own datasets. Preparation of **dedicated services** available in the platform will include both work on technical platform functionality as well as on data content. Currently, identified services (covered separately in the sections below) include: platform on chemicals monitoring (transfer of current IPCHEM), repository of reference values, information on obligations under EU acts on chemicals (expansion of current EUCLEF), information on regulatory processes (expansion of current PACT), repository of standard data formats and controlled vocabularies and database on environmental sustainability related data.\n\nThe comprehensive roadmap of the Project Initiation Document includes a detailed list of 32 deliverables on content (in addition to 8 deliverables related to project management), planned across the three years of development. Herein some highlight on the extent of planned minimum viable product (MVP):\n\n- Improving the quality of assessments and facilitating a one substance-one assessment approach is the principal supported **use case**; other use cases include the improvement of quality of safety information and data, grouping and prioritisation of chemicals, enhancing knowledge building through sharing of research outcomes (solution under development), provision of methods and standards.\n- The container/content approach to the development of the **technical platform** will be automated to the extent possible, using existing 'building blocks' i.e. relevant services provided by the cloud platform. It will follow the \"intentional architecture, emergent designs\" principle, leading to a container with availability of all necessary networking and development services in the public cloud, with the necessary management tools, identity rules, enforceable policies and security controls, and a modular and extensible character for further evolution of e.g. analytical functionalities.\n- Each dataset planned for integration will be prepared for ingestion into the platform by:\n  - o Basic curation / profiling / metadata according to platform requirements\n  - o Mapping and conversion to agreed formats, use of controlled vocabularies\n  - o Incorporation of agreed substance identifiers, controlled vocabularies and tagging\n  - o Allocation of confidentiality levels / user groups (in MVP, confidential data should be filtered before being disseminated through the platform)\n  - o Quality control after conversion\n  - o Mechanisms for (periodic) ingestion by the platform; updates, versioning\n- The following datasets will be included in the MVP integration:\n  - o **ECHA REACH:** REACH registrations including Chemical Safety Reports (CSR). This dataset already features IUCLID formatted data covering substance information, physico-chemical properties, (eco)toxicological data, environmental fate and use information for more than 24 000 unique substances.\n  - o **ECHA Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP):** Classification and labelling (C&L) inventory. Based on industry C&L notifications for more than 200 000 substances and EU harmonised classifications for ca. 4 600 substances. The C&L inventory is based on a IUCLID C&L format and structured metadata.\n  - o **ECHA Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR):** biocidal active substance approval process data features more than 900 active substance-product type combinations. The\n\nauthorised biocidal products dataset contains over 6 000 approved products. The process information is in a structured format but assessment reports, opinions etc. are included as attachments. The conversion of SPCs (summary of product characteristics) IUCLID format is underway.\n\n- o **ECHA Prior Informed Consent (PIC)**: Substances subject to PIC the Regulation (ca 260 listed substances or substance groups).\n- o **ECHA Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP)**: 1) list of POPs, featuring 30 substances or substance groups; 2) list of substances proposed to be included in the POP list of the Stockholm Convention.\n- o **EFSA OpenFoodTox:** summary of all EFSA chemical risk assessments including chemical identifiers, critical endpoints, toxicological reference values and metadata from EFSA outputs.\n- o **EFSA Chemical Monitoring Data:** Chemical monitoring data for pesticides and veterinary medicinal product residues and contaminants data. The individual measurements of chemicals in food/feed and other materials sampled as part of official controls and enforcement activities in SSD2 format. Sampling by member states is legally mandated under Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and associated implementing acts. Additionally, measurements of chemicals in food and feed received from industry or other sources in response to call for data. This data is available in IPCHEM.\n- o **EFSA OpenEFSA: A**ll information related to EFSA's scientific work. Tracking of the risk assessment process from receipt of dossier to adoption of the opinion. Information available includes status of assessments, dossiers and studies, meeting agendas and minutes, information on experts (DOIs), public consultations).\n- o **EFSA EU\\_PPP Agency IUCLID:** IUCLID dossiers submitted by applicants (industry) under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. Four submission types are supported, EU PPP Active substance, EU PPP Microorganism, EU PPP Maximum Residues Levels, EU PPP Basic substance.\n- o **EEA Air Quality:** The EEA gathers air quality data from a wide range of sources including current status of Europe's air quality through five different air pollutants (European Air Quality Index), latest measurements from Europe's air quality monitoring network and Statistics for air pollutants calculated from officially-verified country data for years until 'X-2'.\n- o **[EEA Waterbase Water Quality:](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/waterbase-water-quality-icm-2)** The dataset contains time series of concentrations of nutrients, organic matter, hazardous substances and other chemicals in rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional, coastal and marine waters. This database also contains the records reported under the Water Framework Directive Watch List for chemicals in surface waters.\n- o **EEA Waterbase emissions:** The dataset contains time series of emissions of nutrients and hazardous substances to water, reported by EEA member countries and cooperating countries. It also contains data on yearly riverine input loads to transitional, coastal and marine waters.\n- o **EEA Industrial emissions:** The data set contains data reported by Member States in the scope of the E-PRTR Regulation and Industrial Emissions Directive. The data is reported annually and includes releases to air/water/land and pollutant transfers of 91 pollutants and waste transfers of hazardous and non-hazardous waste (facilities in the scope of E-PRTR); environmental permit information, application of best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, inspections and other information on IED installations; air emissions, operating hours and energy input from large combustion plants; and nominal capacity from waste incinerators. This data is contained within the same\n\ndatabase. The information is displayed in the European Industrial Emissions Portal and the full database is published on the EEA data service in access format, with some extracts published as Excel spreadsheets.\n\n- o **EEA National Emission reductions Commitments (NEC) Directive emission inventory data:** Data on emissions of air pollutants (ammonia (NH3), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)) reported annually by Member States to the European Commission (with copies to EEA) under Directive 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants.\n- o **EMA human medicinal products data** (environmental risk assessment and nonclinical safety data)\n- o **EMA veterinary medicinal products** (environmental risk assessment and maximum residue limit (MRL) values and MRL assessment data)\n- **IPCHEM (JRC)**: the existing platform for chemical occurrence data in its function and with data will be integrated into the common data platform in two steps (see also section 18). Its data is structured into four modules, according to the chemical monitoring data categorisation: Environmental monitoring, Human Bio-Monitoring, Food and Feed, and Products and Indoor Air.\n- Further datasets to be integrated are identified also as **dedicated services** as they include the need for preparation and curation:\n  - o **Regulatory processes information:** 9 different ECHA processes and related regulatory process data are currently included ECHA's Public Activities Coordination Tool (PACT), providing an overview of substance-specific activities. The scope of the tool under the platform (see section 19) will include contributions by all the agencies.\n  - o **EU Chemicals Legislation Finder (EUCLEF):** An overview of the European Union's legislation on chemicals. This existing service by ECHA will in future be included under the platform (see section 23). It currently contains 51 pieces of legislation and is integrated in ECHA's substance database. For each piece of legislation included in EUCLEF, a summary is provided containing the scope, obligations, exemptions, regulatory activities and lists of impacted substances, together with links to the full legal texts in all EU languages. The data management of EUCLEF data is outsourced by ECHA to a service provider.\n  - o **Repository of reference values:** reference values covered by the datasets described above will be made available from the moment the datasets are ingested in the platform. The outcome of the related **Health-based limit value repository (HBLVR)** study will inform when and in which format the additional datasets could be incorporated in the platform.\n  - o **Formats and controlled vocabularies:** agreed rules will be effectively shared on the platform itself for integration purposes but also for use beyond the platform. This dataset will include the work of (common) substance identification that can be then used across any substance-specific chemical datasets.\n  - o .\n- Introducing principal data-related dimension of the current **European Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)** in the common data platform has been agreed through identification of the observatory as one of further dedicated services on the platform, allowing it also to expand to other chemicals/materials selected to benefit from such additional compilation.\n- As part of the new study notification mechanism, a database of study notifications will be established and accessible through the common data platform.\n\n**Proximity to the mandate of the EU agencies:** While ECHA's core mandate is focused on the safety assessment of chemicals, it also includes the dissemination of information on chemicals and, as expressed in its vision, being 'the centre of knowledge on the sustainable management of chemicals'. A better sharing of data between EU authorities can contribute to the success of ECHA's core mandate. There is a similar proximity in the mandates of the other agencies involved in the development and operation of the platform through collaboration on the interoperability of their respective data to be integrated in the platform. The use of shared data can contribute to the success of their core mandates when tasked with assessments involving chemicals.\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | High      | Process and expertise: ECHA and other agencies already support<br>similar work on data dissemination under REACH and other<br>legislation.

Needs robust governance, clear roles and responsibilities, resources and funding. Legal text needs to include legal basis for ECHA to build and host and govern the platform and for other EU authorities a legal obligation to provide data.\n- Opportunities: The proposal for a regulation establishing a common data platform and a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals should take away barriers to sharing (confidential) data and support its re-use. Opportunities include also further benefits arising from coordinated development of IT services between agencies and a frame that will facilitate the evolution of existing and the development of new digital services and application of artificial intelligence based on chemicals data (e.g. predictive tools, safe and sustainable by design).\n\n#### **Projected impact on agencies:**\n\n- Committees/bodies of the agencies: **no impact**. The task does not require the involvement of committees /bodies\n- Data model(s) and IT infrastructure: **high impact**. The task requires investment in entirely new data structures and IT systems/capabilities, principally on ECHA's side but also on the side of data source owners preparing datasets for integration into the common data platform\n- Key experts: **high impact**. The task relies heavily on expert competencies; while an important segment of preparing the IT solutions can be outsourced, work on internal data linkages and rules supporting integration will rely on internal experts, which are limited within the agencies and also critical to ensure continuity of ongoing regulatory tasks\n\n#### **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nThere are extensive resources already employed in current IT/data infrastructures of the agencies, and in the planning of the (re)attribution of tasks an IT overhead is considered to ensure the tasks are adequately supported. It is expected that some reattribution will take place to optimally exploit synergies with the work on the common data platform. That platform is however a new infrastructure that in spite of longer-term benefits such as an increased effectiveness of tasks and efficiencies of individual IT solutions (formats, vocabularies, reusable building blocks, addressing at least part of dissemination expectation etc.) requires investment to be developed, to prepare the datasets in adequate formats and to cover necessary overhead for operations. For dedicated services described separately in specific sections below, only a summary of the resource estimation is given as a repetition, in order to avoid potential double counting.\n\nEstimates for agencies are made on the basis of the datasets identified to be included in the MVP (see above) and the current state of the dataset and under the assumption that ECHA develops and hosts the common data platform.\n\nThe estimation of workload/resources required is targeting different aspects of the platform's lifecycle:\n\n| Work description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Who                                                                                                   | Resource needs estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Development of the platform (including<br>infrastructure costs until go-live)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Project management<br>Infrastructure setup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                       | Development by 2027;

Collection and hosting of human biomonitoring data\n- 3. Hosting of environmental occurrence data\n- 4. Hosting of indoor air monitoring data\n- 5. Hosting of occupational monitoring data\n- 6. Providing relevant data\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nIPCHEM provides centralised, readily available and automated access to chemical monitoring data held by the European Commission, European agencies, Member State Bodies, Research Centres and Academic Institutions. It provides chemical monitoring data and information of defined quality in terms of spatial, temporal, methodological and metrological traceability as well as a reporting tool for chemical monitoring data (see [https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu\\)](https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).\n\nIPCHEM is a functioning platform hosted and operated by JRC on request of DG ENV. EEA, EFSA and JRC are involved in the operation of the platform as module coordinators and as data providers. Work on IPCHEM is included in the work programme of the agencies.\n\nIPCHEM is currently structured into four thematic modules:\n\n- Module for environmental occurrence data;\n- Module for food and feed occurrence data;\n- Module for human biomonitoring data;\n- Module for product and indoor air data. It should be noted that for this module only the indoor air part is developed and populated with data; templates for metadata and data are developed.\n\nAs described in the IPCHEM governance paper, the IPCHEM governance framework involves many actors with multiple roles, who are involved in many ways at different levels, requiring strong interactions and collaboration.\n\nThese actors are: Policy Lead, Scientific and Technical Lead, Module coordinators, Data providers and Partners/collaborators.\n\nJRC currently has the scientific and technical lead of IPCHEM, with the main responsibilities of:\n\n- Developing and maintaining the IPCHEM platform infrastructure, functionality and security;\n- Coordinating technical development and facilitating harmonisation (standardisation) of metadata and data reporting;\n- Data integration and liaison with data providers;\n- Contribution to exploitation of IPCHEM for policy priorities;\n- Promoting IPCHEM by facilitating its use through technical guidance;\n- Supporting and guiding module coordinators;\n- Strategy formulation and priority setting.\n\nThe four modules are coordinated by different actors, based on the best match of the thematic area with ongoing activities. Current coordinators are EFSA for food and feed, EEA for environment and human biomonitoring and JRC for indoor air and products. The responsibilities of the module coordinators focus on:\n\n- Identifying important data sets and data providers;\n- Supporting the evolution of metadata and data templates in the thematic area;\n- Contributing to the utilisation of IPCHEM for addressing policy questions;\n- Liaison with data providers;\n- Promoting IPCHEM as policy/regulatory support tool.\n\nThe table below describes the four categories of data included in IPCHEM, the associated data sources and updating frequency, actors involved in the data integration process outside the IPCHEM team, to which extent data formats are already harmonised and possible future entities to take care of these data flows:\n\n|   | Source<br>of<br>data | Regular<br>updates | Current<br>players<br>in<br>data<br>handling     | Standard formats                                                                                      | Frequency of related requests<br>to integrate such data into<br>IPCHEM                                                                                                                    | Future<br>expected<br>requests                          | Possible<br>future<br>handling<br>(EU-<br>CDPC<br>data<br>provider) |\n|---|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | MS                   | Yes                | through<br>agency<br>(EEA,<br>EFSA)              | Highly standardised<br>for food and feed<br>Standardised<br>to<br>some<br>extent for<br>environ.

In addition, ECHA will be required to host and maintain occurrence data related to workplace monitoring.\n\nEEA will be responsible for collecting and hosting the human biomonitoring data and for hosting environmental monitoring data and indoor air data currently collected or hosted by JRC as part of IPCHEM.\n\nIPCHEM will be integrated in the common data platform with its functionalities and data representing part of Minimum Viable Product.\n\nThe required tasks are divided according to the container-content concept. The container considers the IPCHEM platform with its data management structure and user interface, while the content refers to the monitoring data contained in the four IPCHEM modules, based on data already included and on anticipated future data needs.\n\nRegarding the content, the four categories of data included in IPCHEM, the associated data sources and updating frequency, actors involved in the data integration process outside the IPCHEM team, to which extent data formats are already harmonised and possible future entities to take care of these data flows are shown in the table above.\n\nRegarding the container, the term refers to the IPCHEM platform with its architecture, data management structures and user interface.\n\nIn the process of integration into the common data platform on chemicals, the data management structure is considered separately from the user interface.\n\n1. **User interface**: The current user interface of IPCHEM was built over many years, is difficult to maintain and also not entirely fit for purpose to address all relevant envisaged uses and search types of IPCHEM.\n\nIt is therefore proposed to re-build the user interface in the context of the integration into the common data platform. The prototype user interface developed by the JRC IPCHEM team in June 2022 should be considered as a starting point and to help estimate the resources needed. The new user interface implementation is expected to be driven by the IPCHEM and the common data platform's use cases involving monitoring (occurrence) data.\n\n2. **Data management structure:** IPCHEM has a generalised structure, that aims to accommodate the monitoring data regarding different media and coming from several data providers. The current harmonisation process encompasses all the transformation steps required from the source data structure to the IPCHEM harmonized one. Two different record layouts are enforced, one for the individual measurement type of datasets and the other for the statistical type of datasets; in both cases, only a common subset of the data is harmonised, and quality checked, while the remaining information provided are encapsulated as-is into a generic field called source data, using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format as a convenient yet flexible vehicle.\n\nIPCHEM has two sub-systems: IPCHEM Portal is the subsystem providing access to the harmonised and integrated data, while IPCHEM Share is the subsystem providing the file-sharing feature, compliant with the requirements defined by JRC Local Informatics Security Officer for the secure hosting of sensitive non classified data (e.g. two-factor authentication, encryption at rest, token secured application programming interface (API), etc.).\n\nIt is advised to preserve this current structure of the system, in the transfer to the common data platform. The IPCHEM team is preparing detailed documentation and can support the hand-over.\n\nA 2-step approach is proposed as the most efficient way of integrating IPCHEM into the common data platform:\n\n#### **1 st phase (months 1-12): making monitoring data from IPCHEM findable via the common data platform, and preparatory work for functionality handover (co-work JRC/ECHA)**\n\n## **Aims:**\n\n- IPCHEM extended team contributes to the work on data, in particular the selection of substance identifiers and the selection of the supported format for inclusion of monitoring (occurrence) data.\n- IPCHEM data contribution to the common data platform is analysed (data governance and policy) in accordance with the legislative proposal on data\n- IPCHEM extended team carries out a study to make metadata and data available in IPCHEM more FAIR, including harmonisation of module specific metadata and data fields with the common data platform requirements (point above), including in the preparation for the anticipated future data providers to the platform for individual datasets\n- Linking IPCHEM to the common data platform via metadata and substance identifiers; substance search will bring back links to IPCHEM datasets with the metadata description in agreed format<sup>22</sup>\n- Analysis (container/functionality handover), identification of use cases, implementation planning\n\n# **Tasks**\n\n- 1.

Governance aspects, data management\n\n## **Resource needs 1st phase**\n\n- Platform development (60K)\n  - o 1 developer full time for 8 months for complementing in IPCHEM the information and formatting required for the linking with the common data platform, in addition to what is already available in the public repository [\\(https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/public\\)](https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/public), or in the IPCHEM share subsystem [\\(https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/share](https://ipchem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/share) via secure API); this encompasses possible enhancements (e.g. JSON-LD / RDF metadata format, DCAT-AP service, etc.) to make the system more FAIR;\n- Handover preparation (120K)\n  - o 1 analyst, expert in chemicals monitoring in charge of supporting substance identification and metadata and data harmonisation (in close collaboration with module coordinators) for 12 months\n  - o 1 regulatory expert to prepare the adoption of more harmonised formats and perform impact assessment (on the common data platform, data providers and modules coordinators) for 12 months\n\n#### **2 nd phase (months 12-36): IPCHEM full integration into the common data platform**\n\n## **Aims:**\n\n- Single interface to IPCHEM data through common data platform\n- IPCHEM functionalities are gradually handed over to the platform\n- A new governance is put in place incorporating harmonisation and regulatory updates\n- Data flow is established between the data providers (agencies) and the platform\n\n## **Tasks**\n\n- 1.

Supporting ECHA in the design\n\n## **Resource needs 2nd phase**\n\n- Platform development (100K)\n  - o 1 developer full time for 18 months for fully integrating IPCHEM metadata and data into the common data platform\n- Dataset preparation (220K)\n  - o 1 data analyst, expert in chemicals monitoring, in charge of enhancing the IPCHEM metadata and data formats (i.e. to make metadata and data more rich and FAIR), for 24 months\n  - o 1 regulatory expert to prepare full transfer of the data management process (data policy, governance, data flows, etc.), for 18 months\n\n## **Proximity to agencies' mandate:**\n\n- While ECHA's core mandate is focused on the safety assessment of chemicals, ECHA's mandate includes the dissemination of information on chemicals. A better sharing of data between EU authorities can contribute to the success of ECHA's core mandate. As ECHA is tasked to operate the common data platform on chemicals, the operation of IPCHEM and its integration into that platform fit well with ECHA existing tasks.\n- EEA already acts as a module coordinator for human biomonitoring and thus hosting of human biomonitoring data would fit with the existing mandate of EEA. Hosting human biomonitoring data, environmental monitoring data and indoor air quality data fits well into EEA work on human health and the environment, as the data provides a good basis for the assessment of environmental impacts on human health.\n- ECHA is currently performing scientific assessments underpinning the setting of occupational exposure limit values so hosting occupational monitoring data fits well with its mandate.\n\n| Type                     | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High      | Process and expertise:<br>ECHA already supports similar work on data dissemination under<br>REACH and other legislation.

The task heavily relies on expert competencies, but these are present in the agencies.\n\n## **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n## Current workload and resource use:\n\nJRC has a total of 4.5 FTE (2.5 JRC staff, 2 external consultants intramuros) assigned to the IPCHEM operation. There are also resources allocated to the contribution to IPCHEM in the work programmes of EFSA and EEA.\n\nThe current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG JRC                                                             | 4.5 FTE per year (2.5 JRC staff and 2 external consultants intramuros) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Yearly IT maintenance costs from JRC<br>corporate hosting facility | EUR 11 700 per year                                                    |\n| Total                                                              | 4.5 FTEs annually                                                      |\n\nCurrent budget line: DG JRC institutional work programme\n\nFuture workload and resource use:\n\nThe integration of IPCHEM into the common data platform, the continuous provision of data by the agencies to the IPCHEM and coordination/cooperation among the agencies is included in the resource estimates under the common data platform on chemicals. The integration will be done jointly by JRC and ECHA. ECHA will take over the operation of IPCHEM from JRC and will take over hosting of occupational monitoring data. For this ECHA will need 2 FTEs. In addition, EEA will take over from JRC collection and hosting of human biomonitoring data and hosting of IPCHEM environmental occurrence data and indoor air monitoring data. For this, EEA will need 1 FTE per year. EFSA already provides data to IPCHEM and contributes to its operation and will not require any additional resources to continue in this activity. EMA and EU-OSHA currently do not systematically collect or receive data relevant for IPCHEM and therefore will not require any additional resources.\n\nSummary of resource needs for maintaining IPCHEM and its parts after its integration into the common data platform on chemicals:\n\n| Agency  | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                           |                                                                                  |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA    | Operation and development of IPCHEM<br>Collecting and hosting occupational monitoring data                                                                                                                                          | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 180 000<br>2028: EUR 180 000             |\n|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 0 TA, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TA, 1 CAs<br>2027: 1 TA, 1 CAs<br>2028: 1 TA, 1 CAs |\n| EEA     | Collecting and hosting human biomonitoring data,<br>developing a data model and creating a reporting structure to host human biomonitoring data.<br>Hosting indoor air data<br>Collecting and hosting environmental occurrence data | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 200 000<br>2027: EUR 200 000<br>2028: EUR 50 000        |\n|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2027: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2028: 1 TA, 0 CAs |\n| EFSA    | Provision of occurrence data                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                         |\n| EMA     | Cooperation and coordination on IPCHEM                                                                                                                                                                                              | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                         |\n| EU-OSHA |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 0 FTEs<br>2026: 0 FTEs<br>2027: 0 FTEs<br>2028: 0 FTEs                     |\n\n## Future budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n#### **21. INFORMATION ON REGULATORY PROCESSES ON CHEMICALS**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: ECHA (existing (P)ACT), EFSA (existing OpenEFSA)\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EFSA EEA and, EU-OSHA\n\n**Legal basis for (re-)attribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n**Type of task:** Existing but expanded to cover all chemical sectors\n\n**Brief task overview:** (1) Operating (public) activities coordination tool; (2) notifying relevant information to the (public) activities coordination tool\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nThe Activities Coordination Tool and its public counterpart, (P)ACT, are two existing information systems developed and operated by ECHA which provide an up-to-date overview of all planned and ongoing initiatives on chemicals by authorities under REACH and CLP. The information is provided in user-friendly tables and is regularly updated. The information is provided by authorities and includes information on authorities' actions (intention/on-going/finalisation) relevant for an assessment process.\n\nACT helps authorities to coordinate their work by providing information on planned, ongoing or completed substance-specific activities. PACT (public ACT) ensures transparency of regulatory safety assessment work. It gives the public an 'early warning' of the substances that are on an authority's radar for exploring the need for regulatory risk management and provides a more holistic picture of what is going on under different regulatory processes. The processes and legislation already covered by (P)ACT are indicated in the table below.\n\nThrough a recent project, ECHA reviewed the tool to improve its efficiency and functionality and to allow extension to further processes under its remit.\n\nEFSA, as part of their existing activities, also provide some level of digital transparency on their planned, ongoing and concluded assessments, as part of their general OpenEFSA portal. The portal provides access to information related to EFSA's scientific work, tracking of the risk assessment process from receipt of a dossier to adoption of the opinion. Information available includes: status of assessments, dossiers and studies, meeting agendas and minutes, information on experts (DOIs) and public consultations. The OpenEFSA portal is similar to PACT. The OpenEFSA portal does not have a confidential 'ACT' part. The processes and legislation already covered by OpenEFSA are indicated in the table below.\n\nMetadata and formats behind both IT tools are not easily comparable, but a lot of work has already been put in the organisation of this information and in building processes to keep updating the systems.\n\n## Changes in the process:\n\nTo promote the coordination of safety assessment activities across EU legislation, the 'one substance, one assessment' approach considers progressively expanding the existing (P)ACT from including REACH and CLP regulations to including all relevant chemicals legislation with safety assessment processes and initiatives.\n\nECHA will operate an extended (P)ACT service, starting with a similar functionality of the existing tool but addressing processes across all the sectors where chemical assessments are performed. ECHA will provide relevant information into (P)ACT for all the processes from legislation for which ECHA is or will be an assessment body. EFSA will provide to ECHA for integration into (P)ACT the relevant information for all the processes from legislation for which EFSA is an assessment body and that are already covered in the OpenEFSA portal. In other words, EFSA is toensure that OpenEFSA information feeds into the (P)ACT and is further complemented for confidential part on intentions, where relevant. Finally, EEA and EU-OSHA will provide to ECHA for integration into PACT any relevant information for the process from legislation for which EU-OSHA is an assessment body. The processes and legislation to be included in the extended (P)ACT are identified in the table below. The extended (P)ACT will be available as a specific service under the common data platform (dedicated service on 'information on regulatory processes on chemicals'), with the identification of individual processes as well as associated datasets (starting with substance identification) covered by the controlled vocabularies. The service will maintain the differentiated authorities/public access, with up-to-date public information on declared registries of intent, status of assessment in progress and outcomes (including documentation) once concluded. Authorities will have access to further categories and datasets for informing on preliminary intent supporting exchange and coordination as appropriate, and where relevant access to working material during the process. The governance will be done through the governance of the common data platform on chemicals.\n\nTo control complexity, a solution as regards the update of the information in the platform, maintenance of relevant lists, metadata and supporting datasets will need to be prepared by the agencies involved as principal actors in particular processes, even for cases where further actors may be involved or even ultimately responsible for the process outcome (e.g. national authorities).\n\nOverview of legislation and processes included or to be included in (P)ACT (referred to as 'information on regulatory processes on chemicals' as the dedicated service in the common data platform on chemicals):\n\n| Legislation

high**, as it developed and operated the tool, and is designated as the manager of the common data platform in the future. For EFSA **very high**, as EFSA already operates the OpenEFSA portal.\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:**\n\nSynergies come from the fact that one system or dedicated service can serve multiple agencies. The added value of the system is that all agencies and stakeholders will be able to find out at one place about the ongoing or planned regulatory processes on substances. The development of the dedicated service on information on regulatory processes on chemicals (I.e. extended PACT) will be done as part of the development of the common data platform on chemicals, exploiting the same governance process and building blocks required.\n\n## **Main risks and opportunities:**\n\nThe development of an all-encompassing controlled vocabulary and rules for all the different contributors will be extensive. It is however not considered a risk as all processes are individually well controlled by the agencies responsible for the implementation of the individual pieces of legislation. Risks are mitigated by the designated role of the agencies. The dedicated service on information on regulatory processes on chemicals provides a major opportunity to facilitate the coordination between the assessments and reuse of assessments performed elsewhere, to avoid duplication of work and to save time when informed decisions on further management actions can be taken.\n\n## **Projected impact on agencies**\n\n- Committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require the involvement of committees /bodies (with the exemption of their secretariat that will be the main provider of respective information from the committees to the dedicated service on information on regulatory processes, as is the case now for PACT)\n- Agencies' data model and IT infrastructure: **high impact**. The same considerations apply as for the development of the common data platform in its entirety. The data models of 4 agencies for this type of information will have to be aligned.\n- Agencies' key experts: **no impact**. The task does not require a specific expertise. The task is effectively just a reporting/documenting of the processes.\n\n## **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\n| Work description

REPOSITORY OF REFERENCE VALUES**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: ECHA (some reference values as part of EUCLEF), EFSA (some reference values as part of open food tox database), Commission – DG SANTE (some reference values as part of the pesticides database)\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EFSA, EMA, EU-OSHA [and Commission – DG SANTE]\n\n**Legal basis for (re-)attribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n**Type of task:** Existing but extending the scope and centralizing the reference values in one repository\n\n**Brief task overview:** Setting up and operating a centralized repository of reference values derived or collected as part of the implementation of Union chemicals legislation or on the request of the Commission also those provided by the Member States or international organization.\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n## Current process:\n\nEFSA has developed and is maintaining the OpenFoodTox database<sup>1</sup> . It is a structured database (Exel sheet) summarising the outcomes of all hazard identification and characterisation for human health (plant protection products, food improvement agents, and contaminants), animal health (feed additives, pesticides and contaminants) and the environment (feed additives and pesticides) performed by EFSA. OpenFoodTox provides information on substance identity and characterisation, links to EFSA's related output, relevant background EU legislation, and a summary of the critical toxicological endpoints and reference values for the substance. The data model of OpenFoodTox has been designed using an OECD Harmonised Template (OHT) as a basis to collect and structure the data in a harmonised manner. The database is being populated by an external contractor who extracts the relevant information from the EFSA opinions. The database contains scientific values from EFSA's opinions. Currently, relevant information from all opinions delivered by EFSA is already included in the database and EFSA continues updating the database.\n\nThe EU pesticides database<sup>2</sup> is the official source for pesticide Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) in food products. It is maintained by the Commission – DG SANTE - and it contains both the current and historical information on MRLs of pesticides with the residue definition and a coded list of commodities to which the MRLs apply. The database contains regulatory reference values from the relevant legislation. The Commission – DG SANTE - continues updating it.\n\nECHA has developed and operates the EU Chemicals Legislation Finder (EUCLEF)<sup>3</sup> . It is an online service to access an overview of 56 pieces of EU chemicals legislation. The purpose of EUCLEF is to offer users the possibility to navigate through the EU chemicals legislative framework and find relevant information on how substances are regulated across the EU. EUCLEF was developed to help companies who need to track their obligations across different EU laws. EUCLEF lists some regulatory reference values derived and applicable under these legislative pieces. There might be an overlap between information in EUCLEF and in the EU pesticides database.\n\n## Changes in the process:\n\nECHA establishes and operates the centralized EU repository of reference values as part of a database with information on the provisions and legal obligations applicable to chemicals under the Union acts by adapting the existing EUCLEF system (see section 23). Both the repository of reference values and a dedicated service on information on the obligations under EU acts on chemicals (i.e. an expanded EUCLEF system) are established as part of the common data platform and the governance structure of the platform is also used to govern the development and operation of the repository of reference values.\n\nECHA makes available in the repository all regulatory reference values adopted under EU chemicals legislation (this is broader than today and contains more metadata information).\n\nECHA extracts and feeds into the repository all 'legacy scientific reference values' from ECHA's opinions (i.e all reference values already derived by ECHA before the entry into force of the regulation establishing the common data platform and which are not formally adopted under EU legislation). For 'new reference values' ECHA starts providing reference values on a continuous basis to the repository as new opinions are adopted by ECHA.\n\nEFSA provides the collection of 'legacy scientific reference values' (i.e. those which are not formally adopted under EU legislation but derived by EFSA) from the Open Food Tox to ECHA to be integrated in the repository. For 'new scientific reference values' (i.e. those that are not formally adopted under EU legislation but derived by EFSA) EFSA continues providing relevant information on a continuous basis to the repository (or to ECHA) as new opinions are adopted by EFSA.\n\nThe Commission – DG SANTE - continues to operate and populate the EU pesticide database with new regulatory reference values. The Commission – DG SANTE - establishes a dynamic link for provision of the information from the EU pesticide database to ECHA to be made available also via the repository.\n\nEMA provides on a continuous basis to ECHA all new (i.e. adopted after entry into force of the regulation establishing the common data platform) predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) derived as part of the environmental risk assessment under Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EU) 2019/6\n\nEEA and EU-OSHA provide on a continuous basis to ECHA all new scientific reference values they might derive in the future, as currently they do not do so.\n\nThe governance of the common data platform is used for governing the development and operation of the repository.\n\n## **Proximity to agencies' mandate:**\n\nThe tasks fit well with the mandate of each agency. EFSA, ECHA and EMA provide scientific reference values from the assessments they perform. ECHA is already operating EUCLEF and is tasked to operate the common data platform, so for ECHA it is an extension of its current work.\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\nOperating only one repository of reference values compared to several separate ones will save resources. The existing IT solution and contractual arrangement available in ECHA can be reused.\n\n**Main risks and opportunities:** There might be an overlap between reference values in the repository and in the EU pesticide database.\n\n## **Projected impact on agencies**\n\n- ECHA/EMA/EFSA committees/bodies: **low impact**. The rapporteurs of opinions might be asked to extract the reference values and metadata for integration into the repository as part of the finalisation of the opinion.\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **medium impact**. The task requires adaptation of the EUCLEF IT solution.\n- EMA/EFSA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. EMA and EFSA would use the data model set by the repository. They would be reusing the IT solution provided by ECHA. ECHA/EMA/EFSA key experts: **low impact**. Experts are needed to extract relevant information from the opinion into the repository.\n\n## **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\n| Work description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Who                              | Resource needs estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Agency                           | Cost/Resource Implications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Setting up the repository on the basis of EUCLEF<br>Designing and developing the repository as expansion of EUCLEF and as part of the common data platform<br>Coordination of and consultation with other agencies contributing to the repository (as part of the common data platform) during development | ECHA                             | Development by 2028; development duration 3 years (years 2025, 2026, 2027)<br>One-off costs for contracting the development (to supplement IT costs of EUCLEF):<br>-\t2025: EUR 0<br>-\t2026: EUR 550 000<br>-\t2027: EUR 550 000<br>The IT development can be subcontracted but it will need to be overseen/supervised by ECHA staff.

INFORMATION ON THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNION ACTS ON CHEMICALS**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission, delegated to ECHA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for (re-)attribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n# **Type of task:** existing\n\n**Brief task overview:** Operation of a database with information on the provisions and legal obligations applicable to chemicals under the Union acts providing a single point of entry to information on various pieces of EU legislation applicable to a given chemical substance.\n\n#### **Detailed process description**\n\n# Current process\n\nEU Chemicals Legislation Finder (EUCLEF) is a database, compiled by ECHA from multiple sources, presently covering 51 pieces of EU legislation and organized in a way that enables searching and listing all regulations and regulatory lists in which a substance (directly, or inheriting the regulatory context of a parent substance) appears. To ensure continuous relevance, the database is regularly (several times per year) updated. Advanced searches, links to applicable documents and exporting of aggregated results are enabled. Industry, in particular SMEs, is the principal user addressed, as the efficient access to information on obligations reduces costs and increases compliance.\n\nEUCLEF is hosted by ECHA as part of its dissemination pages. EUCLEF has been developed and is maintained by an external contractor managed by ECHA. The information in the database is regularly updated also by the contractor who regularly searches for updates in legislative provisions, such as Eur-Lex, and keeps the EUCLEF database up to date.\n\n#### Changes envisioned as part of setting up common data platform\n\nDatabase with information on the provisions and legal obligations applicable to chemicals under the Union acts will be established as an integral dedicated service within the common data platform. The database will be built from the existing EUCLEF. Its principle task should not change from the existing service, but the scope of EUCLEF will be slightly extended to cover all legislation within the scope of common data platform. In addition, EUCLEF will be reshaped to fit with the standard data format and controlled vocabulary and graphical interface to the common data platform. Further, EUCLEF will be expanded to integrate in it also the repository of reference values, as it partly overlaps in scope but also in sources and approaches required to keep the information updated.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** ECHA has the appropriate data and expertise to perform this task. ECHA already operates the system in its current form and it fits well with the new mandate to operate the common data platform on chemicals.\n\n| Type                                                 | Synergies |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities                             | High      | ECHA's existing processes and methodologies can be fully reused<br>for the new task.

There is an opportunity to allow for a more efficient update of the database by automating the reading of entries from Eur-LEx. For that, a collaboration with the Commission's publication office is required to ensure adequate structuring of the information in Eur-Lex. Another opportunity is to integrate the repository of reference values into the system, using joint efforts and practices.\n\n## **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n- ECHA committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require the involvement of ECHA committees /bodies.\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **medium impact**. Becoming a sustainable part of the common data platform, it will require some changes in the data model. However, being an existing service to be included in the platform, significant efforts in addition to continuous funding at the existing operational level should not be required. Given the investments in IT and data under the EUCLEF task since 2019, its continued implementation would not require significant further efforts in this area.\n- ECHA key experts: **low impact**. The task relies on expert competencies, but as externallysupported service in the operational phase this requires lower ECHA oversight, and the additional support to development the required for integration into the common data platform is expected to be covered by the ECHA experts dedicated to the platform development.\n\n## **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\n#### Current workload and resource use:\n\nECHA already developed and currently maintains the EU Legislation Finder (EUCLEF). It does so under a Contribution Agreement with DG GROW for which it receives a varying sum of money depending on the year (EUR 1 000 000 – EUR 1 400 000 annually), but no posts. ECHA runs the service through the employment of 4 interim staff members (ca. EUR 270 000/year) and outsourcing to contractors: communication activities and external helpdesk ca. EUR 60 000/year, IT costs ca. EUR 200 000/year, data costs ca. EUR 430 000/year. Via the Contribution Agreement this activity does not currently contribute to the cost of running the ECHA (administrative overhead or IT development).\n\n# Future workload and resource needs:\n\nNo additional resources are required for this work. The existing resources for EUCLEF will be used to continue operating, further developing and slightly expanding the system. The dedicated service on information on the obligations under EU acts on chemicals will have to be integrated into the platform, but the resource needs for adaptation are already covered under the common data platform. The major extension of EUCLEF – incorporation of the repository of reference values – are accounted for separately (see section 22). Although no additional resources are required under the proposal for the regulation establishing a common data platform on chemicals and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals, the legislative proposal for a regulation on ECHA that is in preparation should address the fact that the operation of the EUCLEF became a structural task for ECHA and that the financing should become part of the annual contribution to ECHA.\n\n| Work description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Who  | Additional resource needs estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operation of dedicated service on<br>information on obligations under EU acts<br>on chemicals– maintaining the system,<br>periodically updating the database with<br>data                                                          | ECHA | None, but the existing resources and financing for EUCLEF must be<br>maintained.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Development phase - incorporation of the<br>dedicated service into the common data<br>platform: reviewing, aligning database<br>structure and format; association with<br>controlled vocabularies (as they are being<br>developed) | ECHA | Resources required for the integration are already considered by the<br>estimates on EUCLEF operation (above – some level of continuous<br>adaptation to technical progress is part of operation) and under<br>common data platform ECHA common data platform data ingestion<br>estimation. |\n| Development phase – incorporation of<br>repository of reference values into<br>dedicated service on information on<br>obligations under EU acts on chemicals                                                                       | ECHA | Resources estimated under the repository of health-based limit<br>values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the dedicated service on information on obligations under EU acts on chemicals:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                 |  | Financial resource needs:                                | Human resource needs:                                        |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Operation of dedicated service on<br>information on obligations under EU<br>acts on chemicals – maintaining the<br>system, periodically updating the<br>database |  | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0 | 2025: 0 FTEs<br>2026: 0 FTEs<br>2027: 0 FTEs<br>2028: 0 FTEs |\n\nFuture budget line: n/a\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n#### **24. DATABASE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY RELATED INFORMATION**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\n#### Currently: N/A, no current process\n\n## (Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, EEA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n**Type of task:** new (new infrastructure but building on existing datasets)\n\n**Brief task overview:** Setting up and operation of a database on environmental sustainability related data and providing relevant data to the database.\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nThere is an increasing amount of data related to environmental sustainability of chemicals, often generated in research and innovation projects. It is also expected that the implementation of the European Green Deal and its various initiatives, including the implementation of the Safety and Sustainability by Design framework for chemicals and materials, as well as regulatory initiatives such as the Ecodesign Regulation for sustainable products and the Sustainability Corporate Reporting Directive will further increase the availability of certain environmental sustainability data for chemicals.\n\nThere is no ongoing process to systematically collect all relevant information on the environmental performance of chemicals throughout their lifecycle. While there are initiatives compiling (some) data used for sustainability assessments, in particular data needed for the life cycle assessment of products, there are no standard data formats or controlled vocabularies for information related to environmental sustainability, which hinders coherence between assessments of the impacts of the same chemical on the environment.\n\n## Changes in the process:\n\nECHA is to set up and operate a database on environmental sustainability related data, which is established as part of the common pata Platform. For that purpose, ECHA extracts and feeds into the database information from all relevant datasets already integrated in the common data platform but also further relevant external datasets identified by the Commission.\n\nEEA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA provide to ECHA relevant data related to environmental sustainability of chemicals they host or hold in addition to the chemicals data already available in the common data platform.\n\nProgressively, more data will be integrated in the database, as more data will become available in response to the European Green Deal and the various initiatives requiring the assessment of sustainability of materials, products and services. Further datasets presently under preparation by the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) and generated through the implementation of the safe and sustainable by design framework should be utilised and integrated as appropriate.\n\nThe Commission identifies existing datasets on environmental sustainability related information for inclusion in the common data platform and designs relevant related database functionalities.\n\nThe governance of the common data platform is used for governing the development and operation of the database.\n\n## **Proximity to agencies' mandate:**\n\nThe task fits well with the mandate of each agency. ECHA has a long standing expertise on collection of information on substances. It is a key part of ECHA's mandate. Other agencies (EFSA, EEA, EMA and EU-OSHA) also collects or make available information on chemicals related to their mandate. EEA will in the future operate the Industrial Emissions Portal that might collect some data related to environmental sustainability of chemicals on industrial sites, including on 91 pollutants.\n\n# **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\nOperating only one database to systematically collect and relate all relevant information on the environmental performance of chemicals throughout their lifecycle and facilitate operation of tools and efficient assessment of environmental sustainability by different actors leads to synergies.\n\n## **Main risks and opportunities:**\n\nThere is a lot of activity in the field of sustainability assessments leading to multiple and not always coordinated activities and risks of 'lock-in' of specific solutions. A lot is still to be defined and agreed in this field; even some of the concepts are still under development and testing. Precise advance planning of solutions is therefore not possible at present. The opportunity of having a central 'beacon' in the form of a dedicated database around which the activities can coalesce, coordinate and individually contribute is a major opportunity.\n\n## **Projected impact on agencies**\n\n- ECHA committees/bodies: **no impact**. There is no involvement of the committees\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **high impact**. The task requires the development of an IT solution.\n- EMA/EFSA/EEA/EU-OSHA data model and IT infrastructure: **no or low impact**. agencies would provide the data they host or hold.\n\n# **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nThis is a new task and there is no existing work or resources.\n\n#### Future workload and resource needs:\n\nThe additional resources are needed only for ECHA for the development of the database. It is envisaged that the majority of data to be integrated to the database will come from outside the EU agencies, such as research consortia or companies' reporting. The EU agencies currently do not actively collect or receive the relevant data, and if they have any of such data, the amount of information held is currently very limited. Therefore, the resources for provision of such data could be absorbed by the agencies.\n\n| Work description                                                                                                                                          | Who                             | Resource needs estimate                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Setting up the database on environmental<br>sustainability related data                                                                                   |                                 |                                                                                                 |\n| Infrastructure setup<br>Consultation on database functionalities<br>Identification of relevant datasets already<br>integrated in the common data platform | ECHA                            | Development during 6 years (2025, 2026,<br>2027,2028,2029, 2030);<br>ECHA: Staff 1 FTE per year |\n| Providing relevant input on environmental<br>sustainability related information                                                                           | EEA,<br>EFSA,<br>EMA<br>EU-OSHA | Negligible: to be absorbed by the agencies' existing<br>work.                                   |\n| Operating the database on environmental<br>sustainability related data                                                                                    |                                 |                                                                                                 |\n| Integrating additional datasets                                                                                                                           | ECHA                            | Recurrent costs as of 2030:<br>ECHA: Staff 1 FTE per year                                       |\n\n| Providing relevant environmental sustainability<br>related information | EEA,<br>EFSA,<br>EMA,<br>EU-OSHA | Negligible; should be absorbed by the agencies |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n\nSummary of resource needs for the database on environmental sustainability related data:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                        |                           |                                                                                  |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Database on environmental<br>sustainability related data – developing,<br>maintaining the system, periodically<br>updating the database | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                         |\n|        |                                                                                                                                         | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2027: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2028: 1 TA, 0 CAs |\n\nFuture budget line: DG ENV\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n#### **25.

The studies commissioned may have a wider scope than the evidence subject to verification.\n\nAt the same time, pursuant to Article 32 of the General Food Law<sup>60</sup>, EFSA, using the best independent scientific resources available, shall commission scientific studies necessary for the performance of its\n\n<sup>59</sup> Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain and amending Regulations (EC) No 178/2002, (EC) No 1829/2003, (EC) No 1831/2003, (EC) No 2065/2003, (EC) No 1935/2004, (EC) No 1331/2008, (EC) No 1107/2009, (EU) 2015/2283 and Directive 2001/18/EC (OJ L 231 6.9.2019, p.1)\n\n<sup>60</sup> Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety\n\nmission. Such studies shall be commissioned in an open and transparent fashion and EFSA shall seek to avoid duplication with Member State or Community research programmes and shall foster cooperation through appropriate coordination.\n\nEFSA implements this latter obligation through regular commissioning of scientific studies managed by the Science Studies and Project Identification and Development Office (SPIDO). The goals of these projects are:\n\n- Enhance EFSA's capacity to identify studies/projects benefitting regulatory processes/science\n- Fill knowledge gaps to ensure preparedness for:\n  - o Possible divergences on sensitive matters ('verification' studies)\n  - o Future risk assessment requirements dues to evolving scientific knowledge and legislation\n- Enhance capacity building and build partnerships\n\nIf there is a request from the Commission for a verification study, the resources are used for commissioning such study. No request has been received from the Commission so far.\n\nThe EFSA roadmap for the studies for 2022 includes specific projects on artificial intelligence, new approach methodologies, environmental risk assessment, combined exposure to multiple chemicals. For the years 2023 and 2024 the roadmap includes studies on evidence-based risk communication in the EU food safety system, OMICS and bioinformatic approaches in risk assessment, new risk assessment methodologies and harmonised animal welfare data and advancing aggregate exposure to chemicals in EU.\n\n#### New process:\n\nEFSA will continue the operation of their mechanism to commission scientific studies, which is focused on food sector.\n\nECHA will get a mandate to commission scientific studies for the performance of its mission, i.e. in support of the implementation or evaluation of chemicals legislation within the mandate of ECHA. The Commission will be empowered to request ECHA to commission such studies as well.\n\nECHA and EFSA will have to closely cooperate when commissioning scientific studies to avoid duplication, maximise synergies and ensure coherence of safety assessments across legislation in line with the one substance, one assessment objectives.\n\n**Proximity to agencies' mandate:** The task fits well with the mandate of ECHA because it is focused on the commissioning of studies which are in the mandate of ECHA.\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\nThe added value of this task is that ECHA will be able to commission necessary studies and thus improve the implementation and evaluation of the legislation within its mandate and complement the existing mechanism for the chemicals in food sector. Synergies will be achieved by requiring cooperation between EFSA and ECHA. In addition, ECHA will be able to create synergies with the work it is doing in support of PARC.\n\n## **Main risks and opportunities:**\n\nThe main opportunity comes from joined work of ECHA and EFSA on commissioning studies, serving the plethora of chemicals legislation and thus improving the coherence and harmonisation of assessment methods across legislation.\n\n## **Projected impact on agencies** :\n\n• ECHA committees/bodies: **low impact**. The task does not require the involvement of ECHA\n\ncommittees/bodies but ECHA may require input from the committees for the identification of study needs\n\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **no impact**. This task does not have an impact on the IT infrastructure beyond storing the project outcomes\n- ECHA key experts: **medium impact**. The task will rely on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and the agency may need to recruit additional personnel.\n\n# **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent resources allocated to similar work:\n\n| Resources allocated to EFSA for 'food-related data generation mechanism'                    |                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Human resources for additional ad hoc studies                                               | 4 FTEs per year                                                                                                             |\n| Toxicological studies (H2020-FP9)                                                           | 2 FTEs per year                                                                                                             |\n| Additional operational budget for additional ad hoc studies (Prediction: 16 studies a year) | 2020: EUR 6 million<br>2021: EUR 10.5 million<br>2022: EUR 15.0 million<br>2023: EUR 15.0 million<br>2024: EUR 15.0 million |\n\nWhen the PARC project was initiated, 2 FTEs were allocated to ECHA to allow its engagement in the project and support its implementation.\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nEFSA will continue operating its data generation mechanism. The additional work required for EFSA will be to cooperate with ECHA on commissioning studies and on joint decision-making on which studies to commission and how to perform them. These costs should be however absorbed by the existing resources.\n\nIt is envisaged that there will be synergies between the studies run by EFSA and by ECHA, for example from pooling study subjects of the projects into one commissioning. It is therefore expected that ECHA should get a lower amount of human and operational resources than EFSA. No additional resources would be needed to follow the research projects, as such resources were already allocated to ECHA for the PARC project.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for a data generation mechanism:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                |                           |                                                                                  |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Commissioning scientific studies on its own initiative or on the request of the Commission<br>Cooperating with EFSA on commissioning studies and on joint decision-making on which studies and how to follow-up | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 1 000 000<br>2027: EUR 3 000 000<br>2028: EUR 5 000 000 |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 1 TA, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TA, 1 CAs<br>2027: 1 TA, 1 CAs<br>2028: 1 TA, 1 CAs |\n| EFSA   | Cooperating with EFSA on commissioning studies and on joint decision-making on which studies and how to follow-up                                                                                               | Financial resource needs: | Covered by the existing data generation mechanism                                |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Human resource needs:     | Covered by the existing data generation mechanism                                |\n\nFuture budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **26. MECHANISM FOR NOTIFICATION OF STUDIES**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\n# Currently: EFSA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: EFSA (for notifications under the General Food Law<sup>61</sup>), ECHA (for notifications of studies beyond the food sector)\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n#### **Type of task:** new\n\n**Brief task overview:** Operation of an on-line system for receiving and storing notification of information on studies commissioned or carried out cby industry and contractual research laboratories\n\n#### **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nTo ensure that the EU risk assessor has knowledge of all studies performed by an applicant, Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 (Transparency Regulation) contains a requirement to notify studies that are commissioned or carried out in the context of the preparation of an application for approval process in the food chain, at pre-submission phase. Information about the notified studies is made public once a corresponding valid application has been submitted and information on it is made public in accordance with the applicable rules on transparency. The Transparency Regulation also provides for consequences and certain procedural requirements in the case of non-compliance.\n\nThe studies are notified by the industry commissioning them as well as by the laboratories performing them. They are notified to EFSA and EFSA operates an online system (database) for receiving and storing the notifications. The system has existed for since 27 March 2021 and 15 652 notifications were received up until March 2023.\n\nEFSA verifies the compliance with the notification requirements once the application or notification is received in relation to which Union law contains provisions for EFSA to provide a scientific output.. This work is done automatically but requires also some manual checks.\n\n## Future process:\n\nThe obligation to notify studies would be extended from the food legislation to all chemicals legislation except the medicinal and veterinary products. EFSA would continue to operate its existing notifications database for notifications made under the General Food Law, while ECHA would set up its own database for notifications of studies carried out in the context of other EU chemical legislation.\n\nVerification of compliance with the notification requirement would be done by the actor or agency responsible for the legislation in question (e.g. under Biocidal Products Regulation, ECHA would verify the compliance with the notification of studies when application for authorisation for biocidal product or biocidal active substance would be received. Also, under REACH, ECHA would verify the compliance with the notification of studies as part of the compliance check of the registration dossiers).\n\n<sup>61</sup> Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (OJ L 31 1.2.2002, p.1)\n\n# **Proximity to agencies' mandate:**\n\nThe task is very close to the EFSA and ECHA mandate. EFSA already operates a database of notifications for the food sector. ECHA is or will be responsible for the assessment work under the remaining legislation (i.e. legislation beyond food sector), therefore, the operation of the notification database for the remaining legislation fits well with ECHA's mandate.\n\n# **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\nECHA can build on EFSA's existing expertise and experience and can thus ensure harmonised identification of study notifications. Existing processes under the biocidal product regulation (such as application evaluation) and under REACH (such as dossier compliance check) can be used to include checking the compliance with the notification requirements.\n\n#### **Projected impact on agencies:**\n\n- committees/bodies: EFSA **no impact**. The task does not require involvement of EFSA committees /bodies. ECHA – **low impact**. The task would require checking compliance with the notification provisions by the rapporteur member of the biocidal product committee.\n- Data model and IT infrastructure: EFSA **low impact**. The existing repository of studies continues to be operated. The system will have to be linked with or incorporated into the common data platform. ECHA – **high impact**. ECHA will need to set up a new IT infrastructure. In addition, REACH registration will have to be adapted to facilitate the reporting of the notification number for a submitted study.\n- Key experts: ECHA and EFSA **low impact**. The task will rely on expert competencies, which exist in the agencies.\n\n#### **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nThe following resources were allocated to EFSA for the implementation of the notification of studies mechanism as part of the transparency regulation:\n\n| Resources allocated to EFSA for 'food-related notification of studies' |                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Register of commissioned studies                                       | 2 FTEs per year                                                                                       |\n| Register of commissioned studies (development and operation)           | 2020: EUR 160 000<br>2021: EUR 280 000<br>2022: EUR 400 000<br>2023: EUR 400 000<br>2024: EUR 400 000 |\n\n#### Current budget line: DG SANTE\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nECHA will need to set up a database of study notifications and an IT interface for receiving the notifications. The system needs to be operational within 2 years from the entry into force of the legislation (expected mid 2027). ECHA and EFSA will have to cooperate to ensure a common approach for the identification of information notified to both systems. ECHA will have to build an automatic solution that requires lead registrants or applicant to include the notification number into the registration or biocidal product dossiers, respectively, or indicate the reason why a study was not notified. It will also require adapting the dossier format to capture the notification number or justification, and connect the submission system to the database of study notifications. This would be a one-off-cost of adapting the REACH IT and the biocidal products system. For setting up the system it is estimated that additional 3 FTEs per year will be needed and an operational budget of EUR 1 600 000 to commission the external support in the development of the system.\n\nOnce the system is set up ECHA will have to operate it, maintain it and make the necessary adaptations. ECHA will have to provide helpdesk to reply requests of duty holders. ECHA will also facilitate checking the compliance with the notification provisions.\n\nFor the Biocidal Products Regulation, the notification of studies would be checked for active substance approval as part of new applications, Art 95 dossiers and renewals. It can be estimated that there would be a need to check 50 dossiers a year (containing ca. 100 notifications). The notification of studies would be also checked for biocidal product authorisation. In 2022, 160 applications were received (containing ca. 45 notifications). The checks would be performed by the Member States competent authorities, while ECHA would make available to them the summary of notifications. It is expected that verification of notifications would not take more than 4 hours per dossier. This could be absorbed by the overall resources dedicated by the Member States for the evaluation of the applications, as it is marginal compared to the overall resource need for the evaluation of an application.\n\nFor REACH, ECHA receives from lead registrants on average yearly about 3 600 updates of the registrations and about 300 new registrations. Updates can be submitted for a variety of reasons and may or may not contain studies. When submitted in response to an evaluation decision and when submitted due to an increase in information requirements following an increased tonnage band, they most likely contain new studies. Companies may also include new studies for other reasons, e.g. to follow regulatory changes or to strengthen adaptations. The number of annually submitted new studies from increase in tonnage band and in response to evaluation decisions is 1 400. The new registrations are estimated to contain on average 12 studies, i.e. 3 600 studies for 300 new registrations per year. In summary, ECHA receives on average 3 900 registrations per year (updates + new registrations) containing some 5 000 experimental studies that would need to be notified per year. This would result in ca. 7 500 notifications, as it is assumed that ca. 50% of studies would have to be notified also by commercial laboratories.\n\nCompliance with the notification-of-studies requirement would be checked as part of the registration compliance check. ECHA checks approximately 300 registrations per year for compliance. Checking the compliance with the study-notification requirement would not take more than 4 hours per dossier. This would amount to 1 200 hour per year, i.e. ca 0.6 FTE. However, it is likely that registrations selected for a compliance check would not consist of only new registrations or updated registrations for which the requirement of notification of studies applies, and thus the number of checks for complying with study-notifications requirements would be lower. In addition, when one is performing a full compliance check of a registration, the additional time for checking compliance with the studynotification requirement is negligible.\n\nFor any other legislation, ECHA might need to assist Member State authorities in their enforcement action and for those legislative pieces, where a dossier containing studies is submitted by duty holders to ECHA, ECHA can verify the compliance when evaluating such dossier (e.g. under RoHS directive, there might be some 3 dossiers per year requesting derogation which potentially might contain study results).\n\nIt is estimated that 3 FTEs per year and an operational budget of EUR 200 000 per year will be needed for ECHA to operate the system, deal with requests from duty holders and to assist in compliance check.\n\nECHA will have to cooperate with EFSA also on the integration of EFSA's notifications database into the common data platform. This part of work is covered by the resources planned for the common data platform.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                           |                                                                              |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Setup and operation of notifications database and ensuring common approach for the identification of information notified to EFSA and ECHA system<br>Adaptation of the REACH registration system to include study notifications numbers<br>Adaptation of the biocidal products regulation system to include study notifications numbers<br>Helpdesk<br>Verification of compliance with the study notification requirements as part of the REACH compliance check and biocides authorization<br>Support to Member State authorities in enforcement | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 1 200 000<br>2027: EUR 400 000<br>2028: EUR 200 000 |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 1 TA, 2 CA<br>2026: 1 TA, 2 CA<br>2027: 1 TA, 2 CA<br>2028: 1 TA, 2 CA |\n| EFSA   | Continue running its existing notifications database<br>Coordination with ECHA to ensure common approach for the identification of information notified to EFSA and ECHA systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Financial resource needs: | 2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                     |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Human resource needs:     | 2025: 0 FTEs<br>2026: 0 FTEs<br>2027: 0 FTEs<br>2028: 0 FTEs                 |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the mechanism for notification of studies:\n\n## Future budget line: DG Environment\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n## **27.

Establishment and operation of an EU early warning and action system for emerging chemical risks through developing and compiling early warning signals and drawing up summary report to inform regulatory follow up actions\n\n# 2. Establishment and operation of the indicator framework for chemicals\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n# *Current process:*\n\nTask 1 is a new task and there is no ongoing process or activity for this task.\n\nAs regards Task 2 (framework of indicators), the EEA and ECHA are jointly developing a framework of indicators for chemicals policy to monitor the drivers and impacts of exposure of environment and humans to chemicals and to provide a fact base to measure the effectiveness of chemicals legislation in protecting human health and the environment. The framework of indicators is being developed as part of the framework of indicators for zero pollution. The indicators for chemical policies are expected to monitor:\n\n- the drivers of human and environmental exposure to chemicals, namely the production and use of chemicals, regulation of these activities;\n- the impacts of chemicals, in terms of emissions and occurrence in environmental matrices and in humans compared against effect levels, and—where possible—their impacts on human health and the environment;\n- progress with the industrial transition to safe and sustainable chemicals.\n\nThe framework will consist of a set of indicators that is annually updated and presented in the form of a dashboard. EEA and ECHA plan to publish the baseline information for the first set of indicators in 2024. The EEA and ECHA are the technical co-leads of the Commission inter-service working group on chemicals indicators (WG8 of the Chemicals Strategy). During 2021, the working group developed the first concept paper and agreed on the full set of candidate indicators. In 2022 the indicators were further developed, in cooperation with the services involved. For each candidate indicator, EEA and ECHA prepared a prototype and validated data availability, potential data representation and interpretation. In 2023 EEA and ECHA will prepare the dashboard, conclude the development of the indicators and case studies, as well as develop the synthesis report. EEA and ECHA have established a data flow to quantify the selected indicators, and will continue to coordinate work for the preparation of indicators that are expected to be available after 2024.\n\n## *Changes in the process / New process:*\n\n# *Task 1 – early warning and action system*\n\nThis is a new task. The early warning and action system will complement the implementation of the EU legislation on chemicals by adopting a proactive and systematic approach to the identification of emerging chemical risks. The system will consist of an annual compilation of a report summarising the collection of early warning signals, identifying potential emerging risks from chemicals and presenting the report and its finding to the expert working group on one substance, one assessment for discussion and decision on the need for potential follow-up policy or regulatory action. The system would be developed progressively. Initially, it will rely on existing early warning systems and signals, such as the EFSA's emerging risks exchange network [\\(EREN\\)](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/emerging-risks), the national warning systems (*e.g.* [SamTox,](https://www.kemi.se/en/about-the-swedish-chemicals-agency/organisation/the-coordination-group-for-new-and-emerging-chemical-threats---samtox) SIGNAAL), targeted literature searches performed by EEA, as well as on relevant existing data and information made available by EFSA, ECHA, EEA, EMA and EU-OSHA. Progressively, more signals would be developed by the cooperating agencies (i.e. EEA, ECHA, EFSA, EMA, EU-OSHA) and the tools for early warning signals developed by the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) would be utilised and integrated as appropriate.\n\nThe types of signals that could feed into the EU early warning and action system for emerging chemical risks include:\n\n• substances on the market currently produced and used in small quantities but with high growth potential,\n\n- new substances at research and development stage not yet on the market,\n- new scientific knowledge leading to a more critical assessment of the risk (e.g., discovery of subtle effects or sensitive species),\n- New substances on the market, such as recently developed substitutes for regulated substances,\n- substances for which emerging evidence raises concerns due to:\n  - ➢ improvements in the sensitivity of analytical methods,\n  - ➢ chemical mixtures/combination effects of chemicals,\n  - ➢ new toxicological evidence,\n  - ➢ newly identified exposure routes,\n  - ➢ increasing levels and scale of exposure or trends in the profile of the exposure,\n  - ➢ development of the legislation,\n  - ➢ new susceptible at-risk population or at-risk groups.\n- industry data (e.g., development of alternatives, production volumes)\n- biological signals (e.g., biodiversity loss)\n\n# *Task 2*\n\nThis is an existing task. The framework of indicators will be maintained and further developed by EEA in collaboration with ECHA, EFSA, EMA, EU-OSHA and the Commission. The dashboard of indicators shall be integrated into the common data platform on chemicals and the relevant information shall be made available as part of the report on early warnings.\n\n## **Proximity to Agencies' mandate:**\n\nThe task of having a lead for the early warning system for chemicals fits well with the core mandate of EEA, as EEA already operates a number of early warning systems for other areas (e.g. waste). The task of co-developing the indicator framework fits well with the mandates of EEA and ECHA, as ECHA is an agency that as part of the operation of common data platform manages access to all chemicals related data held by other agencies and EEA already operates number of indicators as part of its work on the assessment of the state of environment. The task of providing information/data for the early warning system and indicator framework within their competence fits well with the mandates of EEA, ECHA, EFSA, EMA and EU-OSHA as they collate and hold the relevant information as part of their mandates.\n\n## **Projected synergies and added value of (re-)attribution:**\n\nAttribution of the lead to EEA will provide for synergies with existing early warning systems and with the EEA's work on indicators, including its work on the zero-pollution indicator framework. EEA has already been tasked to develop a framework of indicators in collaboration with ECHA. For EEA, the lead on an early warning system can be considered as a natural expansion of its work on indicators, as several indicators can serve also as early warning signals. In addition, EEA (and also ECHA) are involved in the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) through which they can steer the development of the tools for early warning signals.\n\n## **Projected impact on agencies:**\n\n- EEA/ECHA/EMA/EFSA/EU-OSHA committees/bodies: **low impact**. EEA might use some of their networks for the provision of early warning signals. No other additional impact on committees is expected for EMA, EFSA, ECHA or EU-OSHA\n- EEA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems.\n- EEA/ECHA/EMA/EFSA/EU-OSHA key experts: **low impact**. Expertise existing in the agencies can be used for these tasks.\n\n## **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n# Current workload and resource use:\n\nTask 1 is a new task and there is no existing work or resources.\n\nTask 2 is an existing task. Resources for this work were allocated to both EEA and ECHA, as part of the resource allocation under the 8th Environment Action Programme. ECHA uses 2 FTEs (1 TA and 1 CA) for the development of the chemical indicators (out of 2 FTEs allocated under the 8th EAP). These resources are used by ECHA for the management and consolidation of databases, provision of chemicals data in order to complete the respective emerging risk reports and contribution to chemical policy indicators and other inputs to EEA's work. EEA uses 1 FTE for the work on indicators (out of 15 allocated under the 8th EAP). These resources are used by EEA for the integrated analysis of pollution impacts on environment and health and on reporting on cross-cutting areas of the zeropollution ambition of the green deal, in close cooperation with ECHA and EFSA.\n\n#### Future workload and resource needs:\n\n| Work description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Who                               | Resource needs estimate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Setting up the EU early warning and action system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Identifying and selecting existing working procedures,<br>setting up the necessary contacts with other agencies and<br>Member States experts, developing the early warning<br>signals available in EEA.<br>Compiling report on system set-up, signal generators<br>and data sources, working procedures and consulting the<br>expert group on one substance, one assessment for<br>feedback | EEA                               | Development by 2026;

OBSERVATORY FOR SPECIFIC CHEMICALS WITH POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO EMERGING CHEMICAL RISKS**\n\n## **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission, delegated to ECHA\n\n# (Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common data platform on chemicals, laying down rules to ensure that the data contained in it are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals\n\n## **Type of task:** existing\n\n**Brief task overview:** Operate the observatory for specific chemicals with potential contribution to emerging chemical risks\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n## Current process:\n\nECHA operates EU Observatory for nanomaterials (EUON) that includes the following activities:\n\n- Dissemination and communication (webpages, newsletters, opinions) about different aspects of nanomaterials;\n- Commissioning number of 'paper' studies every year on various aspects of nanomaterials to fill knowledge gaps based on the proposals received from stakeholders via an open call for proposals;\n- Running the NanoData nanotechnology knowledge base which periodically takes stock of market development on nanomaterials (e.g. statistics of growth in sectors, patents, ….);\n- Providing service as a portal to 'nano' community where links to external resources (e.g., eNanoMapper serving as a common resource where EU-funded projects on nanomaterials and nanotechnologies can place their results and where some tools are made available);\n- Operating a database that compiles data on nanomaterials from some sources, such as REACH\n\nregistration, EU nano inventories (FR, BE) - and present it together with a slightly advanced search functionality linked to nanoforms.\n\nThe EUON is funded by the European Commission and is hosted and maintained by ECHA.\n\n# Changes in the process:\n\nContinue performing 'the EUON' activities, maintaining the principal objective of providing transparency on selected class of materials, but modifying its remit and exploiting new infrastructure:\n\n- Expanding the scope to other chemicals and materials, such as complex advanced materials or (other) materials identified through the early warning system, selected based on the assessment by the Commission of expected need and benefit of their inclusion in the observatory;\n- Using as appropriate the new data generation mechanism to commission also studies related to nanomaterials (initially) and, later, also other selected groups of chemicals and materials;\n- Operating a database that compiles data on nanomaterials and making it accessible via the common data platform to maximize integration with information from other datasets in the platform and its utility as additional source of information, including as appropriate in work on the framework of indicators;\n- ECHA to dedicate part of its dissemination effort on chemicals to nanomaterials (initially) and other materials(later).\n\n**Proximity to agency mandate:** the EUON task was assigned to ECHA because it was assessed to have the appropriate data and expertise to perform this task, this is confirmed by the fact that this task has been successfully performed by ECHA for over more than 5 years.\n\n**Main risks and opportunities:** There are clear synergies and overlaps between EUON's compilation of European nanomaterial inventories (\"Search for nanomaterials\" section) and the future EU common data platform on chemicals. There are also clear synergies and overlaps between commissioning studies on nanomaterials and the new data generation mechanism. There might be also some overlaps and synergies between the NanoData nanotechnology knowledge base and the work on the famework of indicators and on the early warning system. The exploitation of these overlaps is an opportunity of the reattribution of tasks proposal.\n\n# **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n- ECHA committees/bodies: **no impact**. The task does not require the involvement of ECHA committees /bodies.\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. Given the investments in IT and data under this task since 2017, its continued implementation would not require significant further efforts in this area. The existing databases can be integrated into the common data platform.\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks.\n\n# **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\n# Current workload and resources used:\n\nThe work is financed via the Contribution Agreement between ECHA and DG GROW and sometimes additional funding from DG RTD. The contribution consists of approximately EUR 700 000 per year (calculated as an average of contributions over the last 10 years: 2016 - EUR 900 000, 2017 – EUR 600 000, 2018 – EUR 600 000, 2019 – EUR 600 000, 2020 – EUR 828 000, 2021 – EUR 600 000, 2022 – EUR 809 000, 2023 – EUR 614 000, 2024 – EUR 619 000, 2025 – EUR 624 000). From the contributions received, ECHA employs 3 CAs (ca. EUR 270 000) and uses ca. EUR 430 000 as an operational budget for commissioning or the calls.\n\nThe current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG GROW – ECHA contribution agreement | 3 FTEs (3 CAs)       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Operational budget                    | EUR 430 000 per year |\n\n# Current budget line: DG GROW (SMP-COSME)\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nKeeping it as a coherent set of services compiling and disseminating reliable information on selected groups of materials, the Commission intends to integrate the work of the EUON into other work streams assigned to the agency, namely operating the nanomaterials database as part of the common data platform, commissioning certain studies through the new data generation mechanism, integrating some signals from the NanoData nanotechnology knowledge base into the work onthe framework of indicators and an early warning and action system, and specific dissemination into general communication on chemicals. The scope of EUON will be also extended to other chemicals and materials, such as complex advanced materials or (other) materials identified through the early warning system, selected based on the assessment by the Commission of expected need and benefit of their inclusion in the observatory\n\nNo additional resources are required for this work, but the existing resources for EUON must be maintained. The existing resources for EUON will be used to continue operating, further developing and slightly expanding the system. The dedicated service on information on the obligations under EU acts on chemicals will have to be integrated into the platform, but the resource needs for adaptation are already covered under the common data platform. Although no additional resources are required under the proposal for the regulation establishing a common data platform on chemicals and establishing a monitoring and outlook framework for chemicals, the legislative proposal for a regulation on ECHA that is in preparation should address the fact that the operation of the EUON became a structural task for ECHA and that the financing should become part of the annual contribution to ECHA.\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for the observatory for specific chemicals with potential contribution to emerging chemical risks:\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                           |                                                                                       |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Commissioning of studies on nanomaterials<br>and other materials potentially presenting<br>new emerging chemical risks (e.g., complex<br>advanced materials via the data generation<br>mechanism<br>Operating 'nanomaterials' database<br>Dissemination and communication on nano-<br>and (e.g., complex advanced) materials<br>Running the NanoData nanotechnology<br>knowledge database.

COOPERATION OF ECHA WITH OTHER EU AGENCIES**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\n# Currently: ECHA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA, expanding the existing tasks\n\n# **Legal basis for reattribution:** ECHA founding regulation\n\n**Type of task:** New, expanding the existing task\n\n# **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Developing methodologies for assessment of chemicals in the fields falling within its mission;\n- 2. Cooperating with other agencies as regards exchange of data, defining formats and controlled vocabularies and development of methodologies related to chemicals;\n- 3. Preventing and solving divergent opinions on chemicals with EFSA and EMA.\n\n# **Detailed process description:**\n\n## Current process:\n\n# *Task 1*\n\nECHA has some very specific tasks with some relevance to the development of methodologies mentioned in the current founding provisions under REACH. The Article 77 of REACH on the tasks of the Agency lists the following tasks:\n\n- providing technical and scientific guidance and tools where appropriate for the operation of this Regulation in particular to assist the development of chemical safety reports (in accordance with Article 14, Article 31(1) and Article 37(4)) and application of Article 10(a)(viii), Article 11(3) and Article 19(2) by industry and especially by SMEs; and technical and scientific guidance for the application of Article 7 by producers and importers of articles;\n- providing technical and scientific guidance on the operation of this Regulation for Member State competent authorities and providing support to the helpdesks established by Member States under Title XIII;\n- providing advice and assistance to manufacturers and importers registering a substance in accordance with Article 12(1);\n- preparing explanatory information on this Regulation for other stakeholders;\n- keeping a Manual of Decisions and Opinions based on conclusions from the Member State Committee regarding interpretation and implementation of this Regulation;\n\nECHA however lacks the mandate and obligation to develop methodologies for the assessment related to chemicals. This disadvantages the ECHA as compared to other agencies and does not allow ECHA to actively participate or contribute to the development of assessment methods.\n\n## *Task 2*\n\nThe ECHA founding provisions under REACH contain provisions related to cooperation. The Article 110 of REACH on the relations with relevant community bodies states:\n\n• The Agency shall cooperate with other Community bodies to ensure mutual support in the accomplishment of their respective tasks in particular to avoid duplication of work.\n\n- The Executive Director, having consulted the Committee on Risk Assessment and the European Food Safety Authority, shall establish rules of procedure concerning substances for which an opinion has been sought in a food safety context. These rules of procedure shall be adopted by the Management Board, in agreement with the Commission. This Title shall not otherwise affect the competences vested in the European Food Safety Authority.\n- This Title shall not affect the competences vested in the European Medicines Agency.\n- The Executive Director, having consulted the Committee on Risk Assessment, the Committee on Socio-economic Analysis and the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, shall establish rules of procedure concerning worker protection issues. These rules of procedure shall be adopted by the Management Board, in agreement with the Commission.\n\nThis Title shall not affect the competences vested in the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work and the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work.\n\nThe existing provisions are rather general. In order to achieve the one substance, one assessment ambition, it is necessary to strengthen the provisions on cooperation and make them coherent with the provisions of other EU Agencies.\n\n# *Task 3*\n\nECHA founding regulation specifies provisions for preventing and solving divergent scientific opinions with other agencies. Article 95 on conflicts of opinion with other bodies states:\n\n- The Agency shall take care to ensure early identification of potential sources of conflict between its opinions and those of community law, including Community Agencies, carrying out a similar task in relation to issues of common concern.\n- Where the Agency identifies a potential source of conflict, it shall contact the body concerned in order to ensure that any relevant scientific or technical information is shared and to identify the scientific or technical points which are potentially contentious.\n- Where there is a fundamental conflict over scientific or technical points and the body concerned is a Community Agency or a scientific committee, the Agency and the body concerned shall work together either to solve the conflict or to submit a joint document to the Commission clarifying the scientific and/or technical points of conflict.\n\nThe provisions need to be aligned with those for other agencies. In addition, there is a need to strengthen the requirement to solve the divergent view by agencies among themselves, before the matter is referred to the Commission to be solved.\n\n## Future process:\n\n## *Task 1:*\n\nECHA should have a mandate to develop methodologies for the assessments related to chemicals it performs based on its needs. It should have also a mandate similar to EFSA to promote and coordinate the development of uniform risk assessment methodologies in the fields falling within its mission.\n\n## *Task 2:*\n\nECHA actively cooperates with EFSA, EEA and EMA as regards:\n\n- exchange of data on chemicals and defining formats and controlled vocabularies for\n\nsuch data\n\n- development of methodologies related to chemicals.\n\nThe cooperation is foreseen both ways, *i.e.* when ECHA itself makes some development in those specified areas within its domain as well as when EFSA, EEA and EMA make some development in those areas within their domains. The goal is to ensure coherence, consistency and interoperability in the specified areas.\n\n## *Task 3:*\n\nECHA and body concerned shall first attempt to solve the divergent opinion on scientific or technical issues by themselves. They shall revert the decision to the Commission only if they were not able to solve the issue. In addition, if the divergence come from divergence in hazard assessment, the Commission should request ECHA to prepare a proposal for harmonised classification under the CLP regulation.\n\n**Proximity to Agency mandate:** The tasks fit well with the mandate of ECHA as all three tasks target the areas of the ECHA mandate, and they are just improvement, specification or expansion of existing tasks.\n\n**Projected synergies and added value of reattribution:** Improving coherence, consistency and interoperability among the Agencies work is the key added value.\n\n## **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n- ECHA Committees/bodies: **low impact**. The task might require some ad hoc involvement of committee/panels or their consultation.\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **low impact**. The task relies on expert competencies, but the task is limited and spread over time in its nature.\n\n## **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n## Future workload and resource needs:\n\nThe work on the new tasks is limited and spread over time in it is nature. On a need basis, it requires that ECHA will develop methodologies for the assessment it performs as regards chemicals. The development and setting the methodology is a standard practice for whoever performs the assessments, so this task can be seen as a formalisation of existing ECHA work. There is no need for additional resources for this task.\n\nECHA will need to cooperate with EFSA, EEA and EMA in the areas on data, formats and methodologies. The need for additional resources for cooperation on these are already covered under the legislative proposal on data (operation of common data platform) or they are already within the mandate of ECHA. Consequently, there is no need for additional resources on this general formal mandate for ECHA to cooperate.\n\nECHA will need to try to solve any divergence in technical or scientific issue with the other agency. ECHA already has such obligation in the existing regulation. The new task will require that the agencies make more effort to solve the issue among themselves, instead of just forwarding the problem to the Commission. Although it might require slightly higher amount of work by the agency as compared to today, such situations are rare and therefore this can be absorbed by the agency without any additional resources.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  | Financial resource needs:                                               |  | Human resource needs:                                                   |  |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n| ECHA   | - Development of methodologies for assessments related to chemicals within its missions<br>- Cooperation with EFSA, EEA and EMA on issues related to chemicals<br>- Preventing and solving divergent opinions or assessments |  | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0 |  | 2024: 0 FTE<br>2025: 0 FTE<br>2026: 0 FTE<br>2027: 0 FTE<br>2028: 0 FTE |  |\n\nSummary of additional resource needs for cooperation of ECHA with other EU Agencies:\n\n## Future budget line: DG GROW\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n#### **30. SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS ON OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE LIMITS**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission, delegated to ECHA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n#### **Legal basis for reattribution:** ECHA founding regulation\n\n**Type of task:** existing\n\n**Brief task overview:** Assessments underpinning setting the EU occupational exposure levels\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### *Current process:*\n\nOccupational exposure limit (OEL) values are adopted under two legal frameworks (Chemical Agents Directive (CAD) and Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive (CMD)) that form an integral part of the EU's mechanism for protecting the health of workers. In addition, there is a specific directive on asbestos that includes an OEL for this substance. Occupational exposure limits adopted by the EU need to be integrated into the national legislative framework.\n\nECHA and its Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) have been supporting the European Commission's Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) by providing scientific opinions on OELs since 2019. This work was previously carried out by DG EMPL's Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL).\n\nFollowing the request from DG EMPL, ECHA prepares a scientific report for its Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) based on the available scientific data and any relevant information collected through a 90-day call for evidence. The scientific report is subject to a 60-day open consultation. RAC then develops its opinion based on a review of ECHA's scientific report and the information provided during the consultation. ECHA's scientific report becomes an integral part of RAC's opinion and forms an annex to the opinion. The adopted final RAC opinion is then forwarded to DG EMPL.\n\nDG EMPL will discuss RAC's report in the tripartite Working Party on Chemicals. This working party prepares a draft opinion on the proposed occupational exposure limit, which is then presented to the tripartite Advisory Committee on Safety and Health for adoption. In the end, the Commission adopts a legislative proposal. For binding OELs, this happens through the ordinary legislative procedure for adoption by the Council and the European Parliament. For indicative OELs, it happens through a Commission directive.\n\nChange in the process: No\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The task is currently already performed by ECHA via an Service Level Agreement (SLA) and is a good fit with its core mandate.\n\n**Main risks and opportunities:** Resources in ECHA staffing are a limiting factor to do more OELs proposals. Capacity of the RAC secretariat is also a limiting factor.\n\n## **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n- ECHA Committees/bodies: **high impact**. The task generates major impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the (additional) workload\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks\n\n#### **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n#### Current workload and resources used:\n\nThe number of RAC opinion on OELs varies between 0 and 3 opinions per year, with average of 1.5 opinion per year.\n\n| Number of RAC opinions on OELs per year |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| RAC opinion on                          | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |\n| Occupational exposure limits (OELs)     | 0    | 2    | 3    | 0    | 2    | 2    |      |\n\nECHA provides scientific advice for the setting of Occupational Exposure Limits under a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with DG EMPL. To assess 5 substances annually, ECHA receives 4 CA posts and in total EUR 975 000 that includes resources for those 4 CA posts.\n\nThe current resources spent by the Commission can be summarized as follows:\n\n| DG EMPL – ECHA Service Level Agreement | 4 FTEs (4 CAs)   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Operational budget                     | EUR 575 000/year |\n\nThrough the SLA this activity does not currently contribute to the staff cost of running the Agency, although it contributes to Infrastructure and Operational costs (administrative overhead or IT development).\n\nCurrent budget line: Budget line of DG EMPL\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nThe Commission intends to stop the arrangement via a SLA and formally assign this task to ECHA by enshrining it in its mandate. The normal resource needs for REACH restriction dossier, which includes also socio-economic assessment and SEAC opinion is 1 (light dossier) - 1.5 (complex dossier) FTEs. As the OEL derivation does not require socio-economic assessment nor SEAC opinion and is principle lighter than restriction dossier, the average resource needs for one OEL is 0.8 FTEs. The Commission wishes to get at least 5 OELs per year, which requires at least 4 FTEs per year. Overhead of 15% is required to contribution for common component of IT tool development (data submission, processing, output), which is additional 0.6 FTE, and overhead of 15 % is required to contribution for horizontal support (governance, enablers, administrative overhead), which is additional 0.6 FTE. In total, it makes 5.2 FTEs\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                             |                           |                                                                                                  |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Preparation of 5 dossiers/year with proposal for OEL<br>Public consultation<br>RAC opinion on the 5 dossiers per year and input from the public consultation | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 200 000<br>2027: EUR 200 000<br>2028: EUR 200 000        |\n|        |                                                                                                                                                              | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2025: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2026: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2027: 3 TA, 2 CA<br>2028: 3 TA, 2 CA |\n\nSummary of resource needs for scientific opinions on OELs:\n\nFuture budget line: DG Employment\n\nCandidate for funding: No\n\n# **31. REACH REGULATION (1907/2006)**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: ECHA\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA (changes in tasks)\n\n## **Legal basis for reattribution:** Revision of REACH regulation\n\n**Type of task:** New or modified existing tasks\n\n#### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- 1. Registration\n- 2. Authorisation\n- 3. Restriction\n- 4. Evaluation\n- 5. Enforcement\n\n## **Detailed process description:**\n\nChange in the process: Yes\n\n#### *Task 1 Registration*\n\nAdditional information requirements are foreseen to enable the identification and regulation of substances, in particular:\n\n- endocrine disruptors and persistent substances, for which new hazard classes have been recently created in the CLP Regulation;\n- polymers will be added to the scope of REACH (notification obligation for all polymers, registration only for those polymers which are more likely to be hazardous);\n\n- chemical safety assessment will be made stricter through a so-called \"mixture allocation factor\" to take into account multiple exposure to different chemical substances (so called \"cocktail effect\"). It will initially only apply to high tonnage substances and with some opt-out possibilities under certain conditions only and if specific risk assessments taking into account multiple exposure are not already provided in the registration dossier;\n- a chemical safety assessment will be required for substances in the 1-10 tonnage band.\n\n#### *Task 2 Authorisation*\n\nREACH authorisation, with its system of applicant by applicant decisions on allowing or not the use of the concerned substances, will be replaced by a simpler, less granular system. Details are still under discussion and include considerations of establishing a system calling for early information on use, exposure and alternatives, notably from downstream uses, to inform the decision on the best regulatory approach per substance.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of essential uses will be implemented to take into account the needs of society (essential uses) or push to faster phase-out of substances for non-essential uses.\n\n#### *Task 3 Restriction*\n\nWhere risks are obvious, simpler restriction procedures in the so-called \"Generic Risk management Approach\" (GRA) will be extended from CMRs to new hazard classes and from consumer to professional uses.\n\nLikewise the authorisation process, the essential use concept will be implemented to derogate essential uses from the restrictions by taking into account the needs of society (essential uses) or to push for faster phase-out of substances for non-essential uses.\n\n## *Task 4 Evaluation*\n\nSeveral provisions related to dossier and substance evaluation and its decision-making will be modified to enhance efficiency of the processes and re-focus attention of testing proposal examinations from volume-considerations to animal testing and complex studies. Annually adopted Community Rolling Action Plan will be replaced with lightweight registry of substance evaluations that would be justified based on hazard or risk considerations. ECHA will also be able to perform substance evaluation alongside MS competent authorities.\n\n#### *Task 5 Enforcement*\n\nA number of actions is foreseen, which include revoking registration in case of persistent incompliance or expiry of the technical dossier, Commission audits of Member States' enforcement systems, improving customs controls, enabling OLAF to investigate breaches of REACH, improving access to justice and dealing with online sales from third countries to consumers.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The tasks are core tasks already performed by ECHA and therefore there is a good fit with its core mandate.\n\n## **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n- ECHA Committees/bodies: **low impact**. The changes in the tasks on restriction and authorisation may slightly reduce the workloead of the committees\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **medium impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n\n• ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks\n\n## **Workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resources used:\n\nCurrent budget line: Budget line of DG GROW\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\n#### *Task 1 Registration*\n\nChanges in Uses and exposure will require:\n\n- Unquantified costs to ECHA to update guidance and IT tools (one-off direct administrative costs);\n- EUR 160 000 costs to ECHA for additional manual Technical Completeness Check (recurrent direct administrative costs).\n\nChanges on registration requirements for polymers:\n\nThe impact assessment estimates that the registration of polymers will entail additional EUR 141 million for ECHA (one-off direct administrative costs). ECHA has provided a more detailed breakdown of costs and FTEs, according to their own estimates:\n\n- Capacity building and guidance development (industry and authority): 5-10 FTE annually from 2024 until 2033, EUR 0.9-1.5 million\n- Notification, incl. support to industry: 10-15 FTE in 2027, 10-20 FTE in 2028, 2029 and 2030, and 10-15 FTE in 2031, marginal onwards, EUR 3 million\n- Developing grouping criteria: 5-10 FTE annually from 2029 to 2032, EUR 1.5-2 million\n- Registration, incl. support to industry: between 10 and 60 FTE annually from 2031 onwards, EUR 4-5 million\n\n|              | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028  | 2029  | 2030  | 2031  | 2032  | 2033  | 2034  | 2035  | 2036  | 2037  | 2038  |       |       |       |\n|--------------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Activity     | unit |      |      |      |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Capacity     | FTE  | 5-10 | 5-10 | 5-10 | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Notification | FTE  |      |      |      | 10-15 | 10-20 | 10-20 | 10-20 | 10-15 | small | small | small |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Grouping     | FTE  |      |      |      |       |       | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  | 5-10  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Registration | FTE  |      |      |      |       |       |       |       |       |       | 10-15 | 15-20 | 30-45 | 35-65 | 35-60 | 35-65 | 35-60 | 25-35 |\n| Total (app)  | FTE  | 5-10 | 5-10 | 5-10 | 15-25 | 15-30 | 20-40 | 20-40 | 30-50 | 25-40 | 35-55 | 35-65 | 35-60 | 35-65 | 35-60 | 25-35 |       |       |\n\n| Capacity     | Euro | € 0.9-1.5 million |\n|--------------|------|-------------------|\n| Notification | Euro | € 3 million       |\n| Grouping     | Euro | € 1.5 - 2 million |\n| Registration | Euro | € 4 - 5 million   |\n\n# *Task 2 Authorisation*\n\nNo change in resource needs expected as a result of the revision\n\n## *Task 3 Restriction*\n\nNo change in resource needs expected as a result of the revision\n\n# *Task 4 Evaluation*\n\nRequired evaluation resources are to an important degree proportional to the registration situation (number of registrations, changes to information requirements) and the ambition level applied (compliance check strategy *e.g.* number of compliance checks).\n\nWhile an assessment of currently ongoing Joint Evaluation Action Plan is only expected at its finalisation in 2027, until which time the current ECHA resources for evaluation are required at current level, it is generally considered that afterwards the proportion of resources working on present and incoming registrations would be freed. On the other side, additional resources to assess and address efficiencies in new polymer registrations will be required after 2031 (see above).\n\nWhile no quantified resource estimate could be made for the application of revocation processes and efficiency measures, it is considered that new needs are offset by the efficiency gains during evaluations and in their follow-up. Similar would apply for the expected increase in testing proposals but ability for a lighter process. The exception is required additional resource for ECHA's contribution to substance evaluations.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Resource needs                                                      |                       |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| ECHA   | Dossier and substance Evaluation:<br><br>• ECHA's contribution to substance evaluations is expected at the level of contribution of a larger Member State (e.g. 3 substances/year, estimated to require 4.5 FTE3) | Note: these are additional resource needs for the ongoing processes | 2027 onwards: 4.5 FTE |\n\nThe evaluation processes are closely tied with the Member State Committee, whose main task is to assess the evaluation decisions. The changes will not require new capacity or change the nature of the work. The number of evaluation decisions to be taken is not expected to importantly change (within +-20%); any increase in testing proposal examination decisions that might come would be associated with likely more simple content from lower tier animal testing.\n\n## *Task 5 Enforcement*\n\nExternal Audit Capacity:\n\n• Costs for ECHA Secretariat for Audit Capacity concerning REACH only, in the range of 0.1 to 0.13 FTE, i.e. from 21.5 working days to 29, which would amount to annual costs for ECHA Secretariat between around EUR 11 481 to 15 486 (recurring annual costs).\n\n- Costs for ECHA Secretariat for External Audit Capacity covering REACH and CLP, in the range of 0.1 to 0.15 FTE, i.e. from 21.5 working days to 32, which would amount to annual costs for ECHA Secretariat between around EUR 11 481 to 17 088 (recurring annual costs), or EUR 225 000 to 335 000 over 30 years. These are related to administrative support to discussions in Forum that may take place in relation to Commission audits of MSs control systems.\n- Forum: some costs will be incurred as it can be expected that in some Forum meetings (maybe once per year) an agenda point may be included to discuss either the Commission programme for audits or the outcome of audits/controls carried out by the Commission.\n\nCustoms:\n\n- Costs for ECHA Secretariat to make the interconnection, under the responsibility of the Commission, of ECHA electronic systems with national single window environments for customs through the EU Single Window Environment for customs, for the automated controls of registrations, authorisations (and restrictions). The budget is estimated at about EUR 100 000.\n- The workload in ECHA to handle this development, its maintenance, and potentially the updates of company accounts by importers and only representatives (around 14 000), the inquiries from companies, as well as the support to the work of the ECHA Forum triggered by these new measures is estimated together at around 1,6 FTEs\n\nThe resource needs for the implementation of the revised obligations under REACH should be absorbed by the existing resources for REACH and CLP.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                                                     |                           |                                                                                                  |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ECHA   | Implementing<br>• Registration,<br>• Authorisation<br>• Restriction<br>• Evaluation<br>• Enforcement | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                          |\n|        |                                                                                                      | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2025: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2026: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2027: 0 TA, 0 CA<br>2028: 0 TA, 0 CA |\n\nSummary of resource needs for REACH revision:\n\nFuture budget line: DG GROW\n\nCandidate for funding: No\n\n### **32. COSMETIC PRODUCTS REGULATION**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of the SCCS committee\n\n(Re-)attribution planned to: ECHA\n\n### **Legal basis for reattribution:** revision of the Cosmetic Products Regulation (1223/2009)\n\n**Type of task:** existing\n\n### **Brief task overview:**\n\n- (1) Safety assessment of chemicals used as ingredients in cosmetic products underlying the authorisation of colorants, preservatives and UV-filters\n- (2) Opinion to the Commission underlying the prohibition or restriction of substances where concerns are raised due to potential risk to human health\n- (3) Safety assessment of chemicals, classified as CMR, used as ingredients in cosmetic products, when an application for exemption was introduced,\n- (4) Opinion to the Commission on the safety of nanomaterials\n- (5) Preparation of Notes of Guidance for the testing of cosmetic ingredients including nanomaterials, non-animal testing methodology, and their safety evaluation\n\n### **Detailed process description:**\n\n#### Current process:\n\nThe Cosmetic Products Regulation requires that the responsible persons and, under certain circumstances, the distributors of cosmetic products notify electronically their products before placed on the European market through the Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP). The information to be submitted is specified in Article 13 as follows:\n\n- the category of cosmetic product and its name or names, enabling its specific identification;\n- the name and address of the responsible person where the product information file is made readily accessible;\n- the country of origin in the case of import;\n- the Member State in which the cosmetic product is to be placed on the market;\n- the contact details of a physical person to contact in the case of necessity\n- the presence of substances in the form of nanomaterials, and their identification including the chemical name (IUPAC) and other descriptors and the reasonably foreseeable exposure conditions;\n- the name and the Chemicals Abstracts Service (CAS) or EC number of substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), of category 1A or 1B, under Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008;\n- the frame formulation allowing for prompt and appropriate medical treatment in the event of difficulties.\n\nThe CPNP is accessible to competent authorities, European poison centres, cosmetic products responsible persons and distributors of cosmetic products.\n\nThe Cosmetic Products Regulation requires that a cosmetic product made available on the market shall be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. In order to demonstrate that, the responsible person shall, prior to placing a cosmetic product on the market, ensure that the cosmetic product has undergone a safety assessment on the basis of the relevant information and that a cosmetic product safety report is set up in accordance with Annex I. The Commission shall adopt appropriate guidelines to facilitate, in particular SMEs, to produce the cosmetic product safety report.\n\nTaking into consideration the impact of the chemical ingredients on human health, the Cosmetic Products Regulation lays down limitations and requirements for the use of substances in cosmetic products. The rules are listed in Articles 14-17 and the following annexes:\n\n- Annex II *-* List of substances prohibited in cosmetic products\n- Annex III *-* List of substances restricted in cosmetic products\n- Annex IV List of colourants allowed in cosmetic products\n- Annex V List of preservatives allowed in cosmetic products\n- Annex VI List of UV filters allowed in cosmetic products\n\nCertain groups of substances, i.e. colorants, preservatives and UV-filters must be authorised by the Commission, i.e. placed on the respective annex (IV, V or VI), prior to their use in cosmetic products. Certain subtances are prohibited (Annex II) and cannot be used in cosmetic products and certain substances are restricted (Annex III) and they can be used only when fulfilling the conditions of the restriction.\n\nThe safety assessment of the cosmetic ingredients (substances) in the EU is performed by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). It is based on safety dossiers submitted by applicants (individual company/associations or by competent authorities) or by the Commission. Based on its opinions, Commission may decide to amend the relevant Annexes. The safety of cosmetic products with all their ingredients is evaluated by \"a person in possession of a diploma or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of a university course of theoretical and practical study in pharmacy, toxicology, medicine or a similar discipline\" (Article 10(2) of the Cosmetic Products Regulation) before placing them on the EU market.\n\nTask 1: Process for the authorisation of colorants, preservatives and UV-filters (including in nano forms) is as follows:\n\n- 1. The amendment of the annexes IV, V or VI of the Cosmetic Products Regulation and associated technical and scientific work is initiated by the submission of a safety dossier by economic operators (applicant) to the Commission.\n- 2. Commission evaluates the completeness of the dossier and prepares a mandate to the SCCS.\n- 3. SCCS performs a risk assessment (9-12 months). The preliminary Opinion is published and open for comments (4-8 weeks) before being finalised. A final opinion is published on the SCCS' website.\n- 4. Commission prepares a Working Document based on the final SCCS Opinion and shares it for discussion with the members of the Working Group on Cosmetic Products (participants: MS, Industry, SMEs and civil society organisations).\n- 5. Commission prepares a Draft Regulation.\n- 6. Draft Commission Regulation is discussed with the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products, which comprises of MS authorities and the Commission.\n- 7. TBT notification is launched with a commenting period of 2 months.\n- 8. MS vote in the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products (comitology) on the draft Commission Implementing Regulation.\n- 9. Scrutiny period by the Council and the European Parliament of 3 months.\n- 10. Adoption of the Regualtion by the Commission and publication in the Official Journal of the EU.\n\nTask 2: Process for prohibition or restriction of a substance used in cosmetic products where concerns are raised due to a potential risk to human health is as follows:\n\n1. The Commission may amend the annexes II and VI of the Cosmetic Products Regulation (CPR) if concerns for human health due to the use of a substance in cosmetics were raised by e.g. Member States, economic operators (industry, SMEs) or civil society organisations (NGOs).\n\n- 2. The Commission evaluates the information/data gathered and prepares a mandate to the SCCS.\n- 3. SCCS performs a risk assessment (9-12 months). The preliminary Opinion is published and open for comments (4-8 weeks) before being finalised. A final opinion is published on the SCCS' website.\n- 4. The Commission may prepare a Working Document based on the final SCCS Opinion and share it for discussion with the members of the WG on Cosmetic Products (participants: MS, Industry, SMEs and civil society organisations).\n- 5. The Commission prepares a Draft Regulation.\n- 6. The draft Commission Implementing Regulation is discussed with the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products.\n- 7. TBT notification is launched with a commenting period of 2 months.\n- 8. MS vote in the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products (comitology) on the draft Commission Implementing Regulation.\n- 9. Scrutiny period by the Council and the European Parliament of 3 months.\n- 10. Adoption of the Regualtion by the Commission and publication in the Official Journal of the EU\n\nTask 3: The use of CMR substances (category 1A, 1B, or 2 under CLP) is prohibited in cosmetic products, apart from \"exceptional\" cases. This prohibition is implemented by amending Annex II-VI of the Regulation. Once a substance receives its harmonised classification as CMRs cat 1A, 1B or 2 under CLP regulation, the Commission must update the annexes of the CPR within 15 months. There is no involvement of SCCS in this process, as there is no safety assessment performed except in the case of derogation requests. Economic operators can, on a voluntary basis, prepare and submit safety dossiers to defend the use of a substance in cosmetics. In such a case the Commission can launch 'calls for data' in order to acquire as much information as possible for a full risk assessment.\n\nIf there is a request from industry for derogation, then the Commission mandates the SCCS to perform a safety assessment and following the outcome of the SCCS assessment the Commission may amend Annexes III - VI.\n\nTask 4: Cosmetic products containing nanomaterials *other than* colourants, preservatives and UV-filters require a specific notification on the CPNP 6 months *before* they are placed on the market. If the Commission has concerns regarding the safety of a nanomaterial, it may request the SCCS to perform a risk assessment. The SCCS may also use information gathered from published literature and/or received from other stakeholders as a result of the Commission's call for data. The SCCS has 6 months to deliver its final opinion. In cases where further data/clarifications are needed, the 6-months clock starts again once the necessary data/information is provided by the applicant.\n\nTask 5: The SCCS, with involvement of the Commission updates approximately every other year a technical guidance document concerning different aspects of testing and safety evaluation of cosmetic substances (called SCCS Notes of guidance'). The emphasis of this guidance is on cosmetic ingredients, including nanomaterials although some guidance is also indirectly given for the safety assessment of finished products. It is designed to provide guidance to public authorities and to the economic operators (safety assessors) to improve harmonised compliance with the current cosmetic EU legislation.\n\n#### **Administrative support for the SCCS**\n\nThe SCCS is currently managed by DG SANTE within the Commission, which provides secretariat services for the committee. The Secretariat is responsible for providing scientific and administrative support necessary to facilitate the efficient functioning of the Committee, to monitor compliance with the Rules of Procedure, particularly in relation to the requirements for excellence, independence, commitment, confidentiality and transparency, to ensure communication on the Committees' activities, the appropriate stakeholder dialogue, publication of the opinions and other relevant documents. Moreover, the Secretariat provides support to the Committee and organises and applies quality control of the opinions as far as completeness, consistency, clarity, correspondence with requests and with editorial standards are concerned. Further tasks can be found in the rules of [procedure.](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/rules_procedure_2016_en.pdf)\n\n### **Changes in the process:**\n\nIt is envisaged that the SCCS will become part of ECHA, and therefore ECHA will take over the secretarial tasks of the committee. It is important that the flexible arrangements are put in place to allow the best integration of the SCCS in ECHA and, in particular, in view of any future reorganisation of the Agency's bodies, that would take into account the experience with SCCS work in ECHA and the need to increase the capacity of the existing committees in ECHA as a consequence of number of reattributions.\n\nIn view of the targeted revision of the CPR, apart from CMRs, additional hazard classes will be subject to risk management measures covering substances classified as endocrine disruptors, and the separate process will be established to examine the safety of substances that could affect the respiratory system and chemicals toxic to a specific target organ toxicant (STOT), which will also require the safety assessment by the SCCS. This is expected to result in a significant increase in the workload of the SCCS and the supporting work of the ECHA's secretariat.\n\n**Proximity to ECHA mandate:** The risk assessment of chemicals including data management and facilitating the work of committees is a core part of the ECHA mandate. The task is therefore closely related to ECHA's core mandate and ECHA has the needed data, competences and expertise to perform the task. Synergies could be achieved if the work of the SCCS committee would be translocated into ECHA, both in terms of efficiencies, as in terms of coherence of scientific opinions.\n\n| Type                     | Synergies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reuse of<br>capabilities | High<br><br>Process and expertise: ECHA already performs similar work on restrictions, derogations and setting of limit values under REACH and other legislation.

There is a need to ensure continuity of the opinion making to ensure undisturbed implementation of the Cosmetic Products Regulation. Working methodologies would need to be adapted.\n\n# **Projected impact on ECHA:**\n\n• ECHA Committees/bodies: **high impact**. The task generates major impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the additional workload and due to a new committee\n\n|                   | SCCS                   |             |                 |\n|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|                   | # of opinions per year | rapporteur  | Type of opinion |\n| Opinions          | 11                     | SCCS member |                 |\n| Notes of guidance | 1                      | SCCS member |                 |\n\n- ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- ECHA key experts: **high impact**. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications:**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nSCCS delivers on average 11 final opinions per year (see table below), while it has a maximum of 20 opinions in the pipeline at any given moment based on its current composition and structure. The SCCS is used mainly to support the Cosmetic Products Regulation but has provided scientific advice for other sectors in the past, albeit rarely.\n\n|                    | Number of SCCS opinions |      |      |      |      |      |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                    | 2016                    | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\n| Number of opinions | 7                       | 9    | 13   | 12   | 6    | 19   |\n\nDG GROW staff has one policy officer (1 FTE) dedicated to the work of the SCCS in relation to the implementation of the CPR. The proposed reorganisation will not change the need for the FTEs from the side of DG as it is not involved in the safety assessment as such.\n\nThe secretariat of the scientific committees hosted by DG SANTE employs 4 FTE of DG SANTE and 2 additional FTEs of external interim staff (for technical and administrative support like literature search, editing and proofreading of opinions, website mastering, assistance for the Health-EU newsletter, dissemination activities). The staff of 6 FTEs is equally split over two committees (i.e., SCCS and SCHEER), which means that 3 FTEs are used to support work of SCCS. The SCCS is structured into 3 working groups that deal with several opinions at the same time (sometimes up to 20). Usually, each SCCS member is a rapporteur for 1 opinion at a time, however, quite often and in view of their expertise some members are rapporteurs for multiple opinions in parallel. External experts sometimes can also be nominated as rapporteurs.\n\nThe operational costs for SCCS and SCHEER (that includes special indemnities, accommodation, daily allowances, travel costs, reimbursement for rapporteurship, etc) operated by the Commission were EUR 2 883 030 for 6 years (2016-2021), which makes it approximately EUR 240 000 per year per committee. It must be noted that the operational costs varies per year. For example, in 2019 the operational costs were EUR 370 000, which then went down because of pandemic measures.\n\n| DG SANTE secretariat | 3 FTEs (2 internal + 1 external)                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SCCS committee       | 100% of membership capacity (14 members + 4 external experts)<br>Yearly operational budget for members of the committee was on 6 year average<br>(2016-2021) EUR 240 000 per year |\n| Total                | Ca. 3 FTEs                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nThe resource use can be summarized as follow:\n\n*(to convert the cost of consultants into FTEs, the cost of 1 FTE consultant is estimated at ca. EUR 66 000 annually)*\n\nSuch Commission resources do not include contributions to the administrative overhead of the Commission (HR, Finance, IT tools, etc.).\n\nCurrent budget line: DG SANTE + DG GROW\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nBecause of the planned introduction of new risk management measures to cover substances classified as endocrine disruptors, and the process for examining the safety of substances that could affect the respiratory system and chemicals toxic to a specific target organ toxicant (STOT), it is expected that the number of exemption requests might grow significantly and that there will be a need for more than the current average of 11 opinions per year, with more than up to 20 opinions in the pipeline at any given moment. However, in view of the maximum capacity of the SCCS based on its current composition the overall number of assessments per year may not change dramatically.\n\nIf the current ECHA estimation of resources is applied to the complexity of dossier reviewed by the SCCS, we can extrapolate the following future allocation of FTEs: 0.35 FTE for low complexity dossier (4 dossiers out of 11 which would require 1.4 FTE), 0.5 FTE for average complexity (4 dossiers out of 11 would require 2 FTE) and 0.65 FTE for complex dossier (3 dossiers out of 11 which would require 1.95 FTE). For 11 opinions per year this makes 5.4 FTEs. Overhead of 15% is required to contribution for common component of IT tool development (data submission, processing, output), and overhead of 15 % is required to contribution for horizontal support (governance, enablers, administrative overhead), which is additional 1.6 FTE. In total, it makes 7 FTEs. In addition, there is a need to cover travelling, accommodation, contingency costs related to members of the SCCS, in total some EUR 300 000/year.\n\n| Agency | Summary of tasks                                                   |                           |                   |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| ECHA   | Assessment for Restriction/prohibition of substances               | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0       |\n|        |                                                                    |                           | 2025: EUR 0       |\n|        |                                                                    |                           | 2026: EUR 300 000 |\n|        | Assessments for authorisation of substances and exemption requests |                           | 2027: EUR 300 000 |\n|        |                                                                    |                           | 2028: EUR 300 000 |\n\nSummary of resource needs for cosmetic product regulation:\n\nFuture budget line: DG GROW\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n## **33.

In particular, the Committee shall provide opinions on questions concerning emerging or newly identified health and environmental risks and on broad, complex or multidisciplinary issues requiring a comprehensive assessment of risks to consumer safety or public health and related issues not covered by other Union risk assessment bodies. Examples of areas of activity include potential risks associated with antimicrobial resistance, new technologies such as nanotechnologies, medical devices including those incorporating substances of animal and/or human origin, tissue engineering, blood products, fertility reduction, physical hazards such as noise and electromagnetic fields, interaction of risk factors, synergic effects, cumulative effects, and methodologies for assessing new risks. It may also be invited to address risks related to public health determinants and nontransmissible diseases.\n- 2. The SCHEER Committee shall also provide opinions on risks related to pollutants in the environmental media and other biological and physical factors or changing physical conditions which may have a negative impact on health and the environment, for example in relation to air quality, waters, waste and soils, as well as on life cycle environmental assessment.\n- 3. Without prejudice to the competences conferred on the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) and other Union bodies undertaking risk assessment, it may also be invited to address questions relating to examination of the toxicity and eco-toxicity of chemical, biochemical and biological compounds whose use may have adverse effects for human health and the environment, including biocides.\n- 4. In addition, the Committee will address questions relating to methodological aspect of the assessment of health and environmental risks of chemicals, including mixtures of chemicals, as necessary for providing sound and consistent advice in its own areas of competence as well as in order to contribute to the relevant issues in close cooperation with other European agencies.\n\n### *Work of Committees in practice*\n\nThe **SCCS** concentrates mostly on the risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients.

[https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific\\\\_committees/docs/rules\\\\_procedure\\\\_201](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific_committees/docs/rules_procedure_2016_en.pdf) [6\\\\_en.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific_committees/docs/rules_procedure_2016_en.pdf).\n\nIn order to ensure the effective functioning of the Scientific Committees, these Rules of Procedure regulate the functioning of the Scientific Committees, their working groups, the role and responsibilities of members and experts, other activities related to the functioning of the Scientific Committees, as well as the role and responsibilities of their secretariat.\n\nThe members of the SCCS and SCHEER are independent experts in various fields, selected after a public Call for Experts and appointed for a five-year term (current one until the end of 2026).\n\n### Changes in the process:\n\nThe **SCCS** is embedded in the Cosmetics regulation as a risk assessment body providing opinions to ensure safety of cosmetics products. In practice, SCCS serves exclusively to the implementation of the Cosmetic Products Regulation. The impact assessment accompanying the Commission Proposal for the revision of the Cosmetic Products Regulation contains analysis of options for reattribution of SCCS's tasks to ECHA. After the reattribution of work for cosmetics regulation to ECHA, there will be no need for DG SANTE operating the SCCS.\n\nThe **SCHEER**'s work is diverse. One part of the SCHEER's work relates to chemicals, namely under the Water Framework Directive/Environmental Quality Standard Directive, Toys Directive, Medical Devices Directive, Cross-Border Health Threats Regulation and Tobacco Directive. This can be re-attributed to the EU Agencies.\n\nOther part of work of the SCHEER covers diverse issues like electromagnetic fields, emerging issues in health and environment, medical devices (like hip or breast implants), safety of LED lights, UVC lamps and sunbeds, use of animals in laboratories, etc. This clearly does not fall under the area of chemicals and it does not really fit to any of the EU Agencies. Such work will be transferred to Scientific Advisory Mechanism – SAM, under DG RTD.\n\nThe SAM consists of the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (in total seven), the Science Advice for Policy by European Academics (SAPEA) consortium and the SAM secretariat. The SAM functions differently than the SCHEER. The basic difference is that the SCHEER directly gets mandates from the mandating Directorates General, i.e. policy Unit dealing with legislative proposals. SAM gives scientific advice to the College and Commissioners on broader issues through a request to the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation. The full SAM procedure is as follows:\n\n- 1. The request for advice is initiated by members of the Commission through a request to the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation.\n- 2. The Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation is responsible for formulation of the request. The SAM secretariat in cooperation with the requesting service prepares a scoping paper. The Cabinet of the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science consults the relevant Cabinets of the Members of the Commission on the final draft scoping paper. If agreed, the Advisors are notified by the SAM Secretariat. The final decision to adopt a scoping paper lies with the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation in cooperation with the Advisors.\n- 3. Once the scoping paper with the related deadline has been adopted, the advisors appoint a lead member who asks SAM secretariat to request SAPEA to gather the evidence. SAPE collects and review the evidence and produces Evidence Review Reports (ERR). Expert workshops which are part of the evidence review process are by default organised by SAPEA.\n- 4. In view of the evidence, the lead member/coordination group will draft the Advisors' advice, also explaining existing uncertainties as well as minority views in science, if considered relevant. The SAM Secretariat will assist the preparation, proof-reading, editing and formatting of the advice.\n- 5. The Advisors will aim for adoption by consensus of its advice. A dissenting opinion by any member(s) of the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors will be noted. Once adopted, the Chair of the Advisors will send the advice to the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation who will transmit it to the other Members of the Commission, including to the President. The Director-General for Research and Innovation will inform the relevant services.\n\nThe way of working might differ, but the non-chemical topics of the SCHEER could fit well under the remit of the SAM, although targeted for a specific piece of legislation:\n\n- Potential risks to human health of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)\n- Biological effects of UV-C radiation relevant to health with particular reference to UV-C lamps\n- Biological effects of ultraviolet radiation relevant to health with particular reference to\n\nsunbeds for cosmetic purposes\n\n- Electronic cigarettes/tobacco additives\n- Potential health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF)\n- Position Statement on emerging and newly identified health risks to be drawn to the attention of the European Commission\n- Estimates of the amount of toy materials ingested by children\n- Use of animals in laboratory testing\n- Synthetic biology\n\n### **Proximity to Agencies' mandate:**\n\nFor chemical work, see the proximity analysis under the Cosmetic Products Regulation, the Water Framework Directive/Environmental Quality Standard Directive/Ground water directive, Toys Directive, Medical Devices Directive, Cross-Border Health Threats Regulation and Tobacco Directive.\n\nFor non-chemical work, Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) of the DG RTD could be the best solution as they already provide scientific advice to the College. The SAM will undergo a reorganization along with the revamping of the scientific advice of the new Commission (2024- 2029) with help of SG.\n\n### **Projected impact on Agencies:**\n\nFor chemical work, see the analysis of projected impact on Agencies under the Cosmetic Products Regulation, the Water Framework Directive/Environmental Quality Standard Directive/Ground water directive, Toys Directive, Medical Devices Directive, Cross-Border Health Threats Regulation and Tobacco Directive.\n\nFor non-chemical work, the projected impact on SAM is:\n\n• SAM Committee/bodies: **high impact**. The task generates major impact on the setup / organisation / staffing of Committees/bodies due to the additional workload\n\n|                                                  | SAM                       |                    |                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                  | # of opinions per<br>year | rapporteur         | Type of opinion |\n| Opinions on non-<br>chemical topics of<br>SCHEER | 1                         | SAM<br>Secretariat |                 |\n\n- SAM data model and IT infrastructure: **low impact**. The task can be implemented with adjustments / configuration of existing data structures and IT systems\n- SAM key experts: **low impact**. The task can be accommodated with existing expertise in SAM\n\n### **Workload and resource implications:**\n\n#### Current workload and resource use:\n\nIn the past, the Secretariat was part of a whole Unit in DG SANTE Brussels and had up to 20 FTEs. After the Secretariat of the Committees moved from Brussels to Luxembourg, the number of staff working for both Scientific Committees started to decline every year. Until October 2022, the Secretariat of both SCCS and SCHEER had worked with its minimum\n\ncapacity: 3 ADs officials, 1 CA and 2 external person/contractor. As of October 2022, in anticipation of the reattribution of tasks, the secretariat was reduced further, to 2 ADs officials and ½ CA. The current Secretariat estimates that minimum number would be 3 FTE per Committee (2 AD level and one secretary plus one external (contractor)). Maximum production capacity for both Committees together is production of up to 25 Opinions per year.\n\n| SCs    | No. of adopted final documents | No. of meeting days* |\n|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| SCCS   | 66                             | 234                  |\n| SCHEER | 29                             | 268                  |\n| ICCG   | 0                              | 5.5                  |\n| Total  | 95                             | 507.5                |\n\n**Number of opinions per Committee per year in term 2016-2021 are:** \n\n| YEAR      | SCCS | SCHEER |\n|-----------|------|--------|\n| 4-12/2016 | 7*   | 2      |\n| 2017      | 9    | 9      |\n| 2018      | 13   | 6      |\n| 2019      | 12   | 3      |\n| 2020      | 6    | 1      |\n| 2021      | 19   | 8      |\n| TOTAL     | 66   | 29     |\n\nThe total budget spent for all the activities was **EUR 3 964 190,89** for term April 2016 to December 2021:\n\n- **EUR 2 883 030,89** were spent for meeting costs reimbursements of Chairs and Rapporteurs, special allowance, etc…\n- **EUR 1 081 160,00** were spent for technical assistance (literature search, editing of opinions, website mastering and dissemination activities).\n\nMore details can be found in their Activity Report: see [activity\\\\_report\\\\_sc\\\\_20132016\\\\_en.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific_committees/docs/activity_report_sc_20132016_en.pdf)  [\\(europa.eu\\)](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/scientific_committees/docs/activity_report_sc_20132016_en.pdf)\n\n# Current budget line:\n\nFor both Committees, as of 2021, the funding comes from the EU budget (EU4Health). In the past it was via Consumer (DG JUST) - mainly for the SCCS - and via Health (SANTE) Programmes.\n\n### Future workload and resource needs:\n\nFor chemical work, the future workload and resource needs are estimated under the Cosmetics Product Regulation, the Water Framework Directive/Environmental Quality Standard Directive/Ground water directive, Toys Directive, Medical Devices Directive, Cross-Border Health Threats Regulation and Tobacco Directive for their respective parts.\n\nFor non-chemical work, the experience over the last 10 years shows that the number of opinions on non-chemical issues is low and amounts to approximately 1 opinion per year. Majority of opinions on non-chemical topics are *ad-hoc*. There are few examples of opinions that are recurrent, like the once on electromagnetic fields (EMF) and on the use of animals in laboratory testing (one opinion approximately every 5 years). Currently the SAM delivers around 3-4 opinions per year. The additional 1 opinion will therefore represent a significant impact. It is estimated that addition 1 FTE for SAM secretariat will be necessary.\n\n| Agency                      | Summary of tasks                          |                           |                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SAM Secretariat<br>(DG RTD) | Opinions on non-chemical topics of SCHEER | Financial resource needs: | 2024: EUR 0<br>2025: EUR 0<br>2026: EUR 0<br>2027: EUR 0<br>2028: EUR 0                                    |\n|                             |                                           | Human resource needs:     | 2024: 0 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2025: 1 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2026: 1 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2027: 1 TAs, 0 CAs<br>2028: 1 TAs, 0 CAs |\n\nSummary of resource needs for non-chemical topics of SCHEER:\n\nFuture budget line: DG RTD\n\nCandidate for fees: No\n\n# **34. ECODESIGN FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS REGULATION**\n\n# **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: N/A, no current process\n\nReattribution planned to: TBC\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** proposal for Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation.\n\n**Type of task:** new\n\n**Brief task overview:** The draft regulation sets a framework provisions and the details of implementation (such as scope, IT formats, etc.) will be set at the later stage via the delegated or implementing acts. The framework provisions do not set any direct obligations on the Agencies. However, it is expected that as part of the delegated acts Agencies will be required to support several technical tasks and operate IT systems. The topic of interest from the chemical perspective is the digital product passport, where ECHA may be expected to provide information on the presence of substances of concern in products (link with the existing SCIP database, but expectations would be broader than the current scope of SCIP). ECHA may be expected to build a bridge between SCIP and the product passports, but the details of the work are not known yet.\n\nThe draft Regulation also includes a provision for the Commission to request ad-hoc advice from the Agencies when assessing the self-regulation measures; it is yet unclear whether and which Agencies' expertise would be required as part of this process and the related workload.\n\n**Proximity to Agencies mandate:** ECHA's core mandate is related to the safety assessment of chemicals. The provision of information on the presence of SoC in products could be seen as an extension of the mandate from chemicals to products and from risk assessment to providing information.\n\n**Main risks and opportunities:** Risk of deviating from ECHA core mandate of safety assessment of chemicals. The scope of information on chemicals in the Digital Product Passports (DPP) is expected not to be the same as in SCIP: Product passport are to report on all substances of concern, while SCIP only reports on the presence of Candidate List substances (SVHCs), which is at least a 100-fold increase in scope. Currently, with ca. 200 SVHCs in scope ECHA has received already 21 million SCIP notifications. If the scope is 100-fold bigger, the number of notifications may become excessive. If the product passport is to be a system among the companies, it remains to be seen how ECHA can contribute to such system and what role it would play.\n\n## **Projected impact on ECHA**\n\n- *ECHA Committees/bodies: no impact. The task does not require involvement of ECHA Committees/bodies*\n- *ECHA data model and IT infrastructure: high impact. The task requires investment in entirely new data structures and IT systems/capabilities*\n- *ECHA key experts: high impact. The task heavily relies on expert competencies, which are limited within ECHA and also critical to REACH/CLP/BPR regulatory tasks*\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications**\n\nCurrent workload and resource use:\n\nNot yet analysed, as the obligations are not yet clear. This will be done as part of the delegated acts once the main act is adopted.\n\nFuture workload and resource needs\n\nNot yet analysed, as the obligations are not yet clear\n\n### **35. TOBACCO PRODUCTS DIRECTIVE**\n\n### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission with the support of the SCHEER Committee\n\n#### Reattribution planned to: TBC\n\n### **Legal basis for reattribution:** revision of the Tobacco directive (2014/40/EU)\n\n**Type of task:** new\n\n**Brief task overview:** The tobacco directive is undergoing an evaluation and a revision of the directive is being envisaged. As part of the revision, a new scientific and technical work is being envisaged that could be potentially attributed to EU Agencies. Currently, Under Article 6(1), the Commission adopted a decision, establishing a priority list of 15 additives for which enhanced reporting obligations are in place, selected on the basis of a SCHEER scientific opinion. It is being considered whether in future in addition, a positive list of ingredients and a database would need to be established. In addition, the work may include:\n\n- Managing the laboratory network on tobacco control;\n- Checking compliance with product presentation provisions;\n- Running the procedure determining characterizing flavour;\n- Updating negative/positive lists of additives;\n- Hosting product database and making publicly available the product information;\n- Monitoring of data in product notifications;\n- Assessing information on leaflets.\n\n**Proximity to Agencies' mandate:** The tasks are not yet clear but those that are being considered do not naturally fit to the agencies considered in this initiative.\n\n**Main risks and opportunities:** ECHA's, EFSA's and EMA's core mandate relates to the safety assessment of chemicals to protect human health and the environment. The proposed tasks are not related to that core mandate.\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications**\n\nFuture workload and resource needs:\n\nNot yet analysed, as the obligations are not yet clear.\n\n### **36. REGULATION ON FLUORINATED GREENHOUSE GASES AND REGULATION ON OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES**\n\n#### **Responsible body:**\n\nCurrently: Commission and EEA\n\nReattribution planned to: TBD\n\n**Legal basis for reattribution:** revision of regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases (517/2014) and revision of regulation on ozone depleting substances (1005/2009)\n\n#### **Type of task:** new\n\n#### **Detailed task overview:**\n\n### Current:\n\nThe Commission is implementing a quota and licencing system for hydrofluorocarbons as well as a similar system for ozone depleting substances (ODS) that both require registration of importers and producers of these chemicals, determination and allocation of company quota and issuing of penalties for non-compliance with the quota system. Annual company reporting data is collected and aggregated by the European Environment Agency each year. The agency prepares a report on ODS and F-gas related activities for Member State representatives and the Commission (DG CLIMA), which includes for instance for F-gases data on imports, exports, production, destruction, and reclamation relevant to bulk F-gases and equipment containing such gases\n\n# Changes:\n\nOn 5 April 2022, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) that would repeal Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 and a proposal repealing Regulation on ozone depleting substance (EC) No 1005/2009. The proposal aims to further reduce emissions of these chemicals. The F-gas proposal would change the existing quota system, gradually reducing the supply of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) to the EU market to approximatively 2.4 % of 2015 levels by 2048 and requiring a quota allocation price which needs to be collected. The quota revenue can partly be used for the implementation of the quota and licensing system. For ozone depleting substances the quota system will be abolished and the licencing system simplified. Both licensing systems and labelling obligations will be strengthened to improve enforcement of trade and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) quota restrictions. Finally, the proposals would align EU legislation with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol.\n\nThe European Environmental Agency (EEA) will have to slightly adapt their reporting tool for undertakings reporting on F-gases and ozone depleting substances, due to changes in the reporting requirements.\n\nThe proposal retains the obligation on the Commission to set up and operate an electronic system for the management of the quota system for HFCs as well as the licensing of imports and exports and reporting for F-gases and for ozone depleting substances. It is not yet clear how the tasks can be implemented most effectively, but it is envisaged that an agency could take some of the tasks in case that would be deemed to be the best option at a later stage.\n\n**Proximity to Agencies' mandate:** The Regulations are still under review and tasks related to setting-up and operating of the electronic system are not yet fully clear. It thus remains unclear if any of the agencies would be suitable for such tasks.\n\n### **Projected workload and resource implications**\n\nFuture workload and resource needs\n\nNot yet analysed, as the tasks are not yet defined"
