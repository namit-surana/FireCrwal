The user then needs to choose KOB and click on Proceed Button.\n\nImage /page/1/Picture/1 description: The image shows two screenshots of a webpage related to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The first screenshot displays the 'Apply Offline Application' section, with a navigation menu on the left side. An arrow points to the 'Apply License' option in the menu, accompanied by the text 'Click here first'. Additionally, an arrow points to the 'Apply License' button at the top right of the screen, with the text 'Click here for Apply'. The second screenshot shows the 'Select Kind of Business' section, where users can choose the state where the license or registration will be obtained. Options such as 'Chandigarh' and 'Delhi' are visible in a dropdown menu. Below this, there are options to select the type of business, including 'manufacturer', 'food retail', 'food services', 'central govt. agencies', and 'head office'. Further down, there are options to select specific types of units, such as 'Dairy units', 'Vegetable oil and processing units', 'Slaughtering units', 'Meat processing units', and 'Food or Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals etc.'\n\n**Step 3:** This step is not required. Neither the screenshot is required which is shown below, it is redundant. (Instead of this add screenshot for 'Apply Registration')\n\n| Dashboard                          | Select Kind of Business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Stage 1 Processing of Registration | Select the state where premises is located for which License/Registration will be obtained.
