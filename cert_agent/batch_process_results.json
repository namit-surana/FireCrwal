Its purpose is to reduce environmental and health risks associated with EEE waste by ensuring that products contain fewer dangerous substances, thus promoting safer recycling and disposal. The Directive applies to nearly all EEE, unless specifically excluded, and is mandatory for manufacturers and importers wishing to place such products on the EU market. Exemptions and amendments are periodically updated to reflect technological and scientific progress.",
