This document provides an overview of the application functions and features along with policy or regulatory aspects. This document, however, does not supersede any direction, official orders or regulations as issued by FSSAI. Furthermore, the guidance document shall not be considered valid for any legal redressal or as evidence in any legal proceeding. This document is only for guiding users on FoSCoS application by providing general information that may be helpful in using the application. This document is expected to be updated from time to time, please check the latest version before use.\n\nIn case any error or omission is noted, please bring it to the notice of FoSCoS team on [foscos-hq@fssai.gov.in](mailto:foscos-hq@fssai.gov.in) for rectification.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-4-0\"></span><span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>*1.Background*\n\nFSSAI had earlier implemented a Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) - an online application to provide licensing and registration functionality. FLRS application enabled the process for FBOs to submit registration/ license applications related to all food businesses and further supported the processing of these applications by the Central/ State licensing authorities. FLRS has been in place from past 9 years. Over the years multiple enhancements and modifications have been done to enhance the usability of application.\n\nHaving observed certain performance challenges and business process limitations in FLRS, FSSAI recognized the need for an upgrade which led to development of a new application - **Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS)**. During development of FoSCoS, care has been taken to ensure that most of it is similar to FLRS application in functionality and process flows to the extent possible while making it more user friendly and also improving its system performance. FoSCoS is built on open source platform, has a new and advanced User Interface, is intuitive, computationally powerful and technically superior to FLRS.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span><span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>*2.Purpose of the Document*\n\nThe purpose of the document is to enable and provide guidance to our primary users i.e. Food Business Operators (FBOs), Designated Officers (DOs) and Food Safety Officer (FSOs) about the newly launched application i.e. Food and Safety Compliance System (FoSCoS). This will also further help the users in transition from our legacy application FLRS to FoSCoS from business perspective. FSSAI is providing this guidance document to provide an overall understanding of the new system and describe the key application functions which would be used to apply and process the Registration/ License applications. Please note that this document does not replace the detailed User Manuals being provided with the application.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-0\"></span><span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>*3.Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS)*\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-1\"></span><span id=\"page-6-1\"></span>*3.1. Introduction*\n\nFoSCoS- Food Safety and Compliance System is a unified application built on open source platform, with enhanced features, easily configurable and has architectural capability to meet the envisaged functionalities and modules. The application is designed in such a way that it has interoperable capabilities to integrate and merge with other FSSAI applications for providing solutions to all kinds of food businesses on single platform.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-2\"></span><span id=\"page-6-2\"></span>*3.2. Objective of FoSCoS application*\n\nOverall objectives of FoSCoS are as follows:\n\n- Transform from the present FLRS which is only a licensing platform to a central food safety compliance regulatory platform.\n- Build a technically advanced integrated application to achieve interoperability with other applications, capable of higher user traffic, and has potential for future upgrades and functionalities.\n- Enhance user performance of the application and make application process simpler and efficient to promote ease of doing business amongst FBOs.\n- Achieve minimal physical documentation and streamline business process flows for FBOs for online application.\n- Achieve and enable the application to have standardized product approach rather than text box approach for manufacturers.\n- Enable application to seed business specific details such as CIN No., PAN No. and GST No. to ensure 360<sup>o</sup> profiling and validation of FBOs.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-3\"></span><span id=\"page-6-3\"></span>*3.3. What are the improved features of FoSCoS?*\n\nTo meet the above objective, process flows and application features of FoSCoS have been enhanced and upgraded for better user experience. Following are the improved key features of FoSCoS:\n\n- Upgradation of hardware and software to ensure enhanced processing speed, least possible downtime, higher user traffic capability and potential for future upgrades.\n- Scalable architecture to meet future upgrades, new modules for additional functionalities and integration with other IT systems of FSSAI. FoSCoS shall in future be the one-stop food safety compliance portal.\n- Paradigm shift in licensing approach from Text Box approach to Standardized Product approach for manufacturers.\n- The Home page has been re-designed to make it more user friendly, intuitive and smart search option for standardized products and eligibility search for any food business is given.\n- New online feature for filling annual returns through FoSCoS application.\n- FoSCoS has been integrated with FoSCoRIS to ensure seamless operations. FBOs will have access to inspections reports.\n- Rationalization of required documents KoB wise instead of complete set of 29 documents indicated previously in FLRS application.\n- Many document-based declarations revised to a check box online declaration.\n- Clear segregation of KoBs in FoSCoS application. For e.g. nutraceuticals and novel food category has been added as a separate category of business under manufacturing.\n- FoSCoS application has been enabled to seed business specific details such as PAN no., CIN no. and GST numbers to ensure 360<sup>0</sup> profiling and validation of FBO.\n\nWhilst above features are comprehensive, detailed list of key features for FBO, DO and FSO are attached for reference in [Annexure-A.](#page-33-0)\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span><span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>*4.Processes defined for FoSCoS application*\n\nBelow section outlines the process flows diagrammatically for various business functions as performed by FoSCoS users i.e. FBOs, DOs and FSOs. The dark colored boxes within process flow represent the new features added in FoSCoS. While this section intends to familiarize the user with FoSCoS application, however for detailed functionality it is recommended to refer the FoSCoS user manuals. Detailed user manual can be downloaded at [https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/user-manual.](https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/user-manual)\n\n#### <span id=\"page-8-1\"></span><span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>*4.1. Process flow to log in on FoSCoS application*\n\nFollowing details should be referred for use of FoSCoS application:\n\n- User credentials i.e. ID and Password: Credentials shall be SAME as used for log-in on FLRS application.\n- However, if the credentials are subsequently changed in FLRS, replication lag of few hours will be observed in FoSCoS or vice versa.\n- FoSCoS URL:<https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/>\n\nFBO can either create sign-up using unique mobile ID and email ID or use same login credentials as used for FLRS application for login.\n\nRefer below the process flow to login for all user types.\n\nImage /page/8/Figure/10 description: This image shows a flowchart of the login process for the FOSCOS website. The process starts with a user, labeled FBO/DO/FSO, navigating to www.foscos.fssai.gov.in. The user then logs in with FLRS credentials. If the login is successful, the user is taken to the dashboard page. If the login is not successful, the user is given the option to click \"Forgot Username/password\" and reset their password, after which they can try to login again.\n\n### <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span><span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>*4.2. Process flows designated for Food Business Operators (FBOs)*\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span><span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>*4.2.1. Process flow for Guest login as Petty FBO*\n\nPetty FBO login facility is the new feature incorporated in the FoSCoS application. This feature has been enabled for small businesses like hawkers, roadside vendors, etc who are being encouraged to apply for registrations. This facility enables Petty FBO Login with OTP validation through phone number or email address without creating sign-up details or a password. On Login the Petty FBO shall have access to only Registration related functionalities which means License related functionalities shall not be available unlike the case of regular FBO Login.\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/4 description: The image shows a flowchart of the process for a Petty Food Business Operator (FBO) to apply for a registration certificate. The process begins with the Petty FBO navigating to the website www.foscos.fssai.gov.in. Next, the Petty FBO applies for a registration certificate. Then, the Petty FBO verifies the OTP on their email ID or mobile of choice. After that, the \"Apply for New Registration\" page opens. The Petty FBO then fills out the application for registration and submits the application.\n\n#### 4.2.2. Process followed to submit a new application (Registration/License)\n\nThe process flow of submitting application for registration/ license is similar to FLRS with minimal changes in overall functionality however efforts has been put in place to make process more efficient and productive. Some of key highlights are:\n\n- Revision of questions asked from FBO regarding eligibility of head office. Head office has been added as a separate KoB.\n- Only KoB wise documentation is required to be uploaded along with application.\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/5 description: The image is a flowchart describing the steps to apply for a new license or registration. The flowchart starts with the \"Dashboard Page\" and then proceeds to \"Click 'License/ Registration' in left menu\". The next step is \"Click 'Apply for New License/Registration'\". After that, there is a decision point: \"Head office declared?\". If the answer is \"No\", the flowchart goes to \"Select 'Head office' as KoB\". There is also a tip: \"Nutraceuticals and Novel food are visible under manufacturers KoB\". If the answer to the question \"Head office declared?\" is \"Yes\", the flowchart goes to \"Select appropriate kind of business applicable as per food Business to be conducted\". After that, the flowchart goes to \"Fill 'Form-B'\" and then to \"Submit Application\".\n\n#### *4.2.3. FBO Dashboard*\n\nDashboard is the default landing page once the FBO has logged in. The new dashboard is interactive and intuitive specifically built to provide updates to the submitted applications for both licensing and registration. For easy reference, new actions and feature has been highlighted in colored box. Some of the new features of dashboard in FoSCoS application are:\n\n- FBO can view application status by clicking on tab \"Submitted applications\".\n- FBO can view list of all licenses and registration issued in past.\n\nImage /page/11/Figure/5 description: The image is a flowchart describing the steps to take when an application is reverted with comments. The flowchart starts with the \"Dashboard\" page. If the application is reverted with comments, the user is directed to the \"License/Registration\" page. From there, the user is directed to the \"Reverted Applications by Authority\" page. The user is then instructed to view \"Remarks\" and click \"Proceed\" to update the application, and then submit the updated application. If the application is not reverted with comments, the user is directed to the \"Dashboard\" Tabs. From there, the user can select \"Incomplete Application\" to complete or delete previously created applications, \"Submitted applications\" to view details of submitted applications, \"Applications reverted by Authorities\", or \"Issued\" to view the applications for which a license is generated. The flowchart also includes two tips: one about having 30 days to respond to reverted applications, and another about mailing yourself the license using the Send Mail button under the \"Issued\" tab.\n\n#### *4.2.4. Process to be followed for Renewal of an application*\n\nFBOs can submit request to renew their existing issued licenses/ registrations under the Renewal tab. Renew your license window opens 120 days prior to date of expiry of your license. Hence, it is ideal that renewal application is submitted between time frame of 120 days and 30 days before the date of expiry of license. For e.g. If expiry of your license is 31/03/2020, Thus, the ideal time of application for renewal should be between 02/12/2020 and 01/03/2020.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/3 description: The image shows a flowchart describing the steps to renew a license or registration. The first step is to click \"Renewal\" in the left menu. The second step is to click \"Apply for Renewal of License/Registration\". The third step is to select the license to be renewed. The fourth step is to submit the renewal application. There are two tips included in the flowchart. The first tip is that you can apply for renewal of your license as early as 120 days but at least 30 days before the license expiry date. INR 100 per day is charged as late fees starting 30 days before the license expiry date. The second tip is that if the license/registration has expired already, it will not be listed here.\n\n#### *4.2.5. Process followed to submit Modification request*\n\nFBOs can submit request for modification in the existing issued licenses/ registrations under the modification tab. Three types of modifications are processed i.e. Form-C, Non-Form-C modifications and Change of product category to standardized products for manufacturers only. Non form-c modifications refers to changes such as change in contact details, change in supporting documents submitted at the time of obtaining fresh license, etc. Process flow is given for reference.\n\nImage /page/13/Figure/3 description: The image is a flowchart describing the steps to apply for a modification in license/registration. The first step is to click \"Modification\" in the left menu. The second step is to \"Apply for Modification in License/Registration\". The third step is to select the license to be modified. The fourth step is to select the type of modification. The fifth step is a decision point: \"Is it a 'Form C' modification?\". If the answer is yes, then the next step is to \"Submit Modification application with fees\". If the answer is no, then the next step is to \"Submit Modification application without any fees\". There is also a tip that says: \"Form C modifications are the details of your business which are printed on the license i.e. Company name, Kind of business etc.\"\n\n#### *4.2.6. Process followed for Surrender/ transfer*\n\nFBOs can submit the request for surrender/ transfer of license/ registration by clicking on tab \"Surender\". FBOs shall see the complete list details of all licenses/ registration issued in past. Once selected, FBO may proceed to confirm submission of such request using action button.\n\nImage /page/14/Figure/3 description: This image is a flowchart that describes the process of surrendering or transferring a license. The flowchart starts with a black box that says \"Click 'Surrender/Transfer' in left menu\". From there, the flowchart splits into two paths. The first path is for surrendering a license, and the second path is for transferring a license. The surrender path says \"Click 'Apply for Surrender/Transfer of License/ Registration'\", then \"Surrender using 'Surrender' button against relevant license\", and finally \"Submit request\". The transfer path says \"Click 'Apply for Surrender/Transfer of License/ Registration'\", then \"Transfer using 'Transfer' button against relevant license\", and finally \"Submit request\". There is also a tip that says \"To get duplicate copy of license, click 'Send Mail' button under 'Issued' tab on Dashboard\".\n\n## *4.3. Process flows designated for Designated Officers (DOs)*\n\n### *4.3.1. Process flow to facilitate application requests submitted by FBOs*\n\nThe default landing page after login is Dashboard. DO can view stage-wise activity status of all applications submitted by the FBOs in their jurisdiction.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/4 description: The image is a flowchart that describes the process of applying for a new license. The process starts with the application being received by the DO, and then it goes through several stages of review and approval. The first stage is to check the jurisdiction, and then the offline fee receipts are checked. If the receipts are correct, the application is sent to stage 2 for document securitization. If the documents are correct, the application is sent to stage 3 to determine if an inspection is required. If an inspection is required, the application is allocated to an FSO. The FSO conducts an inspection and forwards the report to the DO. The DO scrutinizes the inspection report and determines if it is satisfied. If the DO is not satisfied, the application is re-inspected and assigned to a new FSO. If the DO is satisfied, or if an inspection is not required, the license is generated. If the offline fee receipts are not correct, the application is rejected and sent back to the FBO for editing. If the documents are not correct, the application is sent back to the FBO for editing. The flowchart also includes two tips. The first tip is that the FSO now has the provision to revert the application in case edits are required in Form-B. The second tip is that the DO has the provision to reassign the application for re-inspection if deemed necessary.\n\n#### *4.3.2. Process flow to facilitate request submitted for Modifications*\n\nThere are two types of modifications submitted by FBOs i.e. Form \"C\" modifications and Non-Form \"C\" modifications. The process to facilitate application for modification submitted by FBOs remains similar to FLRS process and is given below for reference:\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/3 description: The image is a flowchart that describes the process of applying for a new license or modifying an existing license by FBO. The process starts with the application for a new license or modification by FBO. If the application involves Form C modification, it goes through a series of checks. If the offline fee receipts are correct, the application is sent to Stage 2 Document Securitization. If the documents are correct at Stage 2, the process moves to Stage 3, where it is determined if an inspection is required. If an inspection is required, the process moves to Allocate Inspection to FSO, where an FSO conducts an inspection and forwards the results to DO. The inspection reports are then scrutinized by DO. If DO is satisfied, the process is complete. If DO is not satisfied, the process moves to Re-inspection & Assign FSO. If an inspection is not required at Stage 3, the process moves to Generate License. If the application does not involve Form C modification, it goes through a process of scrutinizing Non Form C modification. If the modification is accepted, the process is complete. If the modification is rejected, the process is rejected. If the offline fee receipts are not correct, the application is rejected and sent back to FBO for editing. If the documents are not correct at Stage 2, the application is sent back to FBO for editing. If an inspection is required, the process moves to Allocate Inspection to FSO, where an FSO conducts an inspection and forwards the results to DO. The inspection reports are then scrutinized by DO. If DO is satisfied, the process is complete. If DO is not satisfied, the process moves to Re-inspection & Assign FSO. If the inspection reports are not satisfactory, the process moves to Re-inspection & Assign FSO. The flowchart also includes tips about Form C modifications, FSO, and DO.\n\n#### *4.3.3. Process flow to facilitate renewal request*\n\nThe process flow of a DO for the renewal workflow is similar to a New license approval except that jurisdiction check is not required. Please note that Late fees may have been levied by the system depending on the date of renewal application.\n\nImage /page/17/Figure/3 description: The image is a flowchart describing a renewal process by FBO. The process starts with \"Renewal by FBO\". The next step is a decision diamond, \"Offline fee receipts correct?\". If the answer is no, the process goes to \"Reject application/Send back to FBO for editing\". If the answer is yes, the process goes to \"Send to \\\"Stage 2 Document Securitization\\\"\". The next step is a decision diamond, \"Documents correct? Stage-2\". If the answer is no, the process goes to \"Send back to FBO for editing\". If the answer is yes, the process goes to a decision diamond, \"Inspection Required? Stage-3\". If the answer is no, the process goes to \"Generate License\". If the answer is yes, the process goes to \"Allocate Inspection to FSO\". From \"Allocate Inspection to FSO\", the process goes to \"FSO conducts inspection\", then to \"Forward to DO\", then to a decision diamond, \"Scrutinize Inspection Reports by DO. Satisfied?\". If the answer is no, the process goes to \"Re-inspection & Assign FSO\". If the answer is yes, the process goes back to \"Send application for clarification to FBO\". There are also two tips: \"FSO now has the provision to revert Application in case edits are required in Form-B\" and \"DO has the provision to reassign the application for re-inspection if deemed necessary\".\n\n## *4.4. Process flows designated for Food Safety Officers (FSOs)*\n\n### *4.4.1. Process flow for FSO to use inspection module*\n\nFoSCoS has been integrated with FoSCoRIS to ensure seamless operations. Thus, FSO will be enabled to submit his inspection report directly on FoSCoS application. On login, the FBO shall also have access to view the inspection reports and comments made by the FSOs.\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/4 description: The image shows a flowchart describing the inspection process. The process starts with \"Allocated Inspections\" in the left menu, followed by \"Acknowledge Inspection\" and \"Accept\" and choose Inspection Date. Then, the process branches into \"Start Random Inspection\" and \"Start Inspection\". A decision point asks \"Is FoSCoRIS in use?\". If the answer is no, the process goes to \"Physical checklist used to conduct inspection\" and then \"Upload findings on FoSCoS\". If the answer is yes, the process goes to \"FoSCoRIS app used to conduct inspection\". Both paths converge at \"Inspection Report visible on FoSCoS/ Done manually\". If the inspection report is visible, the process goes to \"Forward to DO\". There is also a \"Reject\" with Remarks option. There are two tips: one about FSO rejecting an inspection and another about FoSCoRIS integration.\n\n## *5. Change in methodology of licensing for manufacturers*\n\n## *5.1. Background*\n\nIn the Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) the process followed for licensing for manufacturers is: -\n\n- An applicant selects the food category system, drilled down to 4-digit level.\n- Then the applicant inputs the food product he proposes to manufacture, in a text box.\n- Licensing authority while processing the application checks if the declared product belongs to the stated category and is standardized as per Food Safety and Standards Regulation (FSSR).\n\nThe Licensing Authority, after other checks he needs to exercise approves the application. Expected output is a licensed product which is standardized. However, the description is subjective. It may be specific to the product/ manufacturer or even be generic or be a variant. If not standardized, application needs to be submitted under Proprietary Food or non- specified Food.\n\n## *5.2. Introduction of Product Selection Approach in FoSCoS*\n\n#### *5.2.1. Key Features*\n\n- The new approach is only for manufacturers of food products.\n- For Category 99 products such as additives/processing aids/enzymes etc., the text box approach will be continued as in FLRS under \"Substances added to Food\"\n- There are few products standardized under FSSR, for which no specific category has been allocated, these products will be listed under a new category 100 (only for the purpose of licensing)\n- In case of non-standardized food products, FBO will need to apply for \"Proprietary Food\", \"Non specified Food\" or \"Food or Health Supplements, Nutraceuticals etc\" as applicable.\n\n#### *5.2.2. Brief description of changes*\n\n- The new system is based on trust and self-regulation approach. An FBO opts and selects a standardized product and his license is approved for the same. The license approval means that the FBO can manufacture only those standardized products which are covered by the description as under in the FSSR. The onus is on the FBO to manufacture only products which are Standardized with the description FSSR.\n- The linguistic meaning of the Standardized product list is NOT to be relied upon. Standardized products means any product whose standards are prescribed in in \"Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011\", \"Food Safety and Standards (Health Supplements, Nutraceuticals, Food for Special Dietary Use, Food for Special Medical Purpose, Functional Food and Novel Food) Regulations, 2016\" and \"Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages) Regulation, 2018\".\n- For manufacturers of Standardized food products, the methodology is being changed from the text box approach to a Standardized product listing approach. FoSCoS is built on food category system as in FLRS with category 1-16.\n- There is a 3-level structure being followed in FoSCoS for Manufacturing, Repacking and Relabeller for selection of food products i.e.\n  - o Level 1: Main Category Example: 7 Bakery Product\n  - o Level 2: Sub-Categories forming part of the main category Example: 7.1 Bread and ordinary bakery wares and mixes\n  - o Level 3: Name of Standardized product (select) Example: Bread\n- The listed products include the types/sub types of products falling under same FSSR number.\n\nExample:\n\n- o 5.1.3 Chocolate: In this all other Standardized products detailed under FSSR covered. i.e whether Milk Chocolate, Milk Covering Chocolate, Plain Chocolate, Plain Covering Chocolate, White Chocolate, Blended chocolate.\n- o 2.9.1 Spice like Caraway (Siahjira): all its types Standardized like (Siahjira), Caraway Black (Siahjira), Caraway (Siahjira) are considered to be covered under description.\n\n- o 2.1.7 Cream and Malai: All types (Reconstituted cream, Recombined cream, Prepared creams etc.) and sub type (Pre-packaged liquid cream, Whipping cream etc. ) are under description Cream.\n- On some occasions, the description of food products has been slightly changed from the heading used in FSSR, primarily because the food category of types and subtypes of the products were distinct.\n\nExample:\n\n- o Separate Food Categories are specified for two variants of Pastas and Noodles i.e 6.4.2: Macaroni Products (Dried) and 6.4.3 Macaroni Products (pre-cooked)\n- o Culinary Sauce and Pastes bifurcated into 12.6.2 (chilli sauce, fruit sauce etc.) & 12.6.3 ( culinary paste)\n- In some cases, the variants (types and subtypes) of Standardized products are listed separately, thereby requiring specific endorsement on license for each of them. The same is done owing to administrative reasons keeping the need of licensing authority and sensitivity of the food products or its nature and source in perspective.\n\nEg. All refined edible vegetable oils are listed as individual refined vegetable oil.\n\n## *5.3. Transition from previous licenses to new standardized product licenses*\n\n- Provision for modification in existing license to choose from standardized product for manufacturers has been provided.\n- No modification fee is required to be paid for the same. The transition will be allowed with modification fee upto 31st December 2020 as per FSSAI order number 15(31)2020/FoSCoS/RCD/FSSAI dated 28th May 2020.\n- The renewals are not linked with modification of License. However, renewal without modification of licence based on list of Standardized products, shall be allowed for one year only.\n\n# *6. Frequently asked questions (FAQ)*\n\n## *6.1.

The said matter was also discussed in the 28<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> meetings of CAC held on 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2020 and 5<sup>th</sup> August 2020 respectively wherein it was decided that kind of business (KOB) wise documents as already uploaded on the homepage of FLRS/FoSCoS (<u>https://foscos.fssai.gov.in/assets/docs/KoBwiseDocumentsrequiredforLicense.pdf</u>) should be followed uniformly by respective Licensing Authorities in all States/UTs. Since the requirement of uploading of signed copy of Form A (application for Registration) and Form B (application for License) by applicants has been done away, all applicants are now therefore, required to upload all documents mandatorily self-attested by the authorised signatory/proprietor.\n\n3. In view of the above, you are requested to direct the concerned Designated Officers/Food Safety Officers to refrain from insisting on submission of additional documents beyond the list issued by FSSAI. The unnecessary insistence on submission of same by Licensing/Registration Authority may attract strict action against them. However, in case of pre-requisite condition of additional document requirement for grant of FSSAI License/Registration by a local body or a State/UT, the same shall be communicated to public through a public order issued by Competent Authority or Commissioner of Food Safety of concerned State/UT.\n\n4. It was also decided to initiate consultation regarding the requirement of NOC from CGWA as a precondition for FSSAI licensing/registration as it is not uniform across the country is depending on the category of areas on the level of ground water. The requirement of NOC from CGWA reportedly hampers timely grant of FSSAI license/registration. Kindly send your comments at the earliest.\n\n5. This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority and in supersession of previous correspondence on the subject of even number dated 31<sup>st</sup> August 2020.\n\nEncl: As stated\n\nfaws 31/8/00\n(Dr Shobhit Jain)\n\nExecutive Director (Compliance Strategy) Email: ed-office@fssai.gov.in\n\nТо\n\n- 1.

Many a time, these additional documents have no direct relevance to the Kind of Business applied for and sometimes they are quite irrelevant like asking for in-house laboratory in food business where is not mandatory, recall plan in case of transporter etc. This causes inconvenience to and harassment of FBOs and undue delay in processing of applications. In this regard, following directions are issued:-\n\n- i. The licensing authorities must avoid demanding additional/irrelevant documents. A list of documents required for each Kind of Business is already available on the Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) and licensing authorities may limit their queries only to those documents. In case any additional document is considered essential, reasons must be recorded for calling the same in FLRS. These reasons shall invariably be submitted to FSC/Director Regional Office for review.\n- ii. Queries should not be asked in piece-meal manner. The application should be properly and carefully scrutinized and all deficiencies in the application should be raised in one go. The observations should be clear, point wise and with a proposed solution to the FBOs.\n- iii. In case of auto generated licenses the licensing authorities shall check those applications to ensure that all documents filed are in order. Else a notice should be issued to FBO and further processing undertaken.\n- iv. The Commissioners of Food Safety and Directors, Regional Offices should have monthly monitoring meetings to review the following cases.\n  - a) Cases where queries have been raised more than twice.\n  - b) Cases where additional documents have been called by DO/FSO.\n  - c) Cases of auto generated licenses due to their non-attendance by licensing Officers.\n\nContd....\n\n2. Any undue delays and multiple queries should be taken seriously and explanation called from the concerned officers. For this purpose, IT division of FSSAI will share the details of queries raised on a single application more than two times and auto-generated licenses on monthly basis. The licensing officers may be directed to submit the cases where additional documents were demanded on monthly basis.\n\n-2-\n\n- 38 -\n\n3. It is requested that necessary instructions may be issued to licensing authorities for strict compliance. Repetition of such delinquency should invite adverse action against erring officials.\n\nf\n22/10/19\n(Dr. Shobhit Jain)\n\n(Dr. Shobhit Jain) Executive Director (Compliance Strategy)"
